[Verse 1]Stuck in bed, stuck in my head Don’t know what to do Unaware or Unprepared With what we’re going through They say we’re gonna be okay With some distance and time away But how long is enough Till we’re both giving up?How much is too much space?[Chorus]‘Cause I’m starting to show sings Has my world been compromised?[Verse 2]The air we share was sacred Now it’s become tainted Do you think we waited for too long?Do I stand a change if I faced it?The older, the harder it makes it Do you think we would’ve been safe if we were strong? If we were strong enough If we were strong enough
