[Verse 1]When I was a child life was a dream I could be happy with just an ice-cream People today just want money and fame Picking up habits that drive them insane Causing them sadness they don't give a fuck All I can tell you is never give up [Pre-chorus]Now it is your turn Your bad habits should burn Just listen to what I say [Chorus]All these little things which make your life livable If it won't work out that shouldn't be an obstacle Don't (Don't) push them away Cause all these little things will sweeten your day [Verse 2]You don't always need to be the bestNo matter if your life feels like a big contest That's when I realized it might be enough This is all about the things that you love Moving ahead don't wanna stay Trapped in decisions that go the wrong way [Pre-chorus]Now it is your turn Your bad habits should burn Just listen to what I say [Chorus]All these little things which make your life livable If it won't work out that shouldn't be an obstacle Don't (Don't) push them away Cause all these little things will sweeten your day [Bridge]I don't need to win the lottery A trip with my friends that’s all I need Life can be full of misery This is the life of the century Yeah, this is the life of the century[Chorus]Don't (Don't) push them away Cause all these little things will sweeten your day Don't (Don't) push them away Cause all these little things will sweeten your day All these little things make your life livable And if it won't work out that shouldn't be an obstacle Don't push, don't push them away Cause all these little things will sweeten your day
