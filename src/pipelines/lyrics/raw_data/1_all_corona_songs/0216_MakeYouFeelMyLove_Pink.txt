[Verse 1]When the rain is blowing in your faceAnd the whole world is on your caseI could offer you a warm embraceTo make you feel my love[Verse 2]When the evening shadows and the stars appearAnd there is no one there to dry your tearsI could hold you for a million yearsTo make you feel my love[Chorus]I know you haven’t made your mind up yetBut I would never do you wrongI’ve known it from the moment that we metNo doubt in my mind where you belong[Verse 3]I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blueI’d go crawling down the avenueNo, there’s nothing that I wouldn’t doTo make you feel my love[Chorus]The storms are raging on the rolling seaAnd on the highway of regretThough winds of change are blowing wild and freeYou ain't seen nothing like me yet[Verse 4]I could make you happy, make your dreams come trueNothing that I would not doGo to the ends of the earth for youTo make you feel my love To make you feel my love To make you feel my love To make you feel my love
