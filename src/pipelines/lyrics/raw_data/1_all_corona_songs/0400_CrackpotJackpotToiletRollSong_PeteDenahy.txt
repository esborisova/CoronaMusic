[Verse 1] 
I’m the chief executive officer of toilet rolls are us
We operate our business with very little fuzz 
My office overlooks the toilet paper factory 
Busy with my toilet paper factory family 
Business had been down a bit 
But we all had the blues
Till some supermarket toilet paper rage got in the news 
With this lightest virus man it’s turned into a craze 
We’re all working harder but we’re all in for a race 

[Verse 2]
We’ve hit the crackpot jackpot 
rolls are running out the door 
you’d better get in quickly or there won’t be anymore 
it’s like a bunch of crazies have found their own vaccine 
with plans to luck the front door 
And keep their backsides clean 
And just when things were looking pretty bleak 
The crackpot jackpot turned the other cheek 

[Verse 3]
There’s supermarkets calling us form all around the land 
trying to stop the costumers from getting out of hand 
A semi load two-plied thanks and send it quickly please 
I’d better call a sawmill for another load of trees
Quality has suffered with the pressure and the stress 
Are their fingers going through it 
I’m afraid the answer’s yes 
But we have to keep on working it’s the busiest we’ve been
There’s a virus out there, friends so your backside must be clean 

[Verse 4]
We’ve hit the crackpot jackpot in the toilet paper trade 
The fortune of our company is well and drooly made 
There’s been a big conversion and it happened over night 
Scrunches became folders yes, they finally saw the light
And we can’t wait for our big holiday 
With the crackpot jackpot throwing cash our way

[Verse 5]
We’ve hit the crackpot jackpot there’re are folk we’d like to thank  
We’ll laugh and drink coronas all the way down to the bank
Thank you social media for sending them berserk 
All the money that we made was worth the extra work 
To all the crazy folk who made our day  
Thanks for wiping all our blues away 
And at the bar tonight we’ll give a cheer 
To the crackpot jackpot toilet roll bums dear
