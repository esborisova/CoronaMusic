[Verse 1: Spoken word]
Hello everyone
There's a virus out there
Be careful
Wash your hands for 20 seconds
Use soap and water or alcohol based after
Cover  your nose, cover your mouth
While you cough and sneeze around
Take a disposable tissue 
For the sake of health issue
Avoid contact, stay distance
From the infected patients
Stay home, report yourself if you doubt
Don't let the virus break out
Cover  your nose, cover your mouth
While you cough and sneeze around
Take a disposable tissue 
For the sake of health issue
Everybody now, wash your hands
Everybody wash your hands

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Wash your hands
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Wash your hands
Wash your, wash your
Wash your, wash your 
Everybody wash your hands

[Instrumental]
Everybody, wash your hands 

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Wash your hands
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Wash your hands
Wash your, wash your
Wash your, wash your 
Everybody wash your hands

[Instrumental]
Everybody, wash your hands 
Everybody, wash your hands 
Everybody, wash your hands 

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Wash your hands
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Wash your hands
Wash your, wash your
Wash your, wash your 
Everybody wash your hands
