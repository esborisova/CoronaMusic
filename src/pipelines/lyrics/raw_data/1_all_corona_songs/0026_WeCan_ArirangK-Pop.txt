[Verse 1]
Wash your hands 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
With loads of soap
Thirty seconds
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
In running water 

[Verse 2]
When you cough
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Cover your mouth
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
And your nose 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
With your sleeve

[Verse 3]
Do not touch
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Or rub your face
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
With your hands
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Please be careful

[Verse 4]
Don't forget 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
It's for you
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
And for us
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Wear a mask
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 5]
Keep your space
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
From each other
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Don't go out
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
And stay home

[Verse 6]
We will all 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Come out strong 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
So take care 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Until we meet 

[Chorus]
I can do it 
(We can face it)
You can do it 
(Altogether)
We can do it
(We can do it)
Yes we can
(Yay!)

[Verse 7]
We will all
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Come out strong 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
So take care 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Until we meet

[Chorus]
I can do it 
You can do it 
We can do it
Yes we can

[Verse 8]
Do your part
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
And stay safe 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Covid-19
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Let's beat it
(Yeah!)
