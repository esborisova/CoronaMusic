[Verse 1]There’s a virus going around And it’s make its way to my heart I think you’ve given me the disease Or I had it from the start They say don’t see a doctor But I need a good inspection Come on baby you and me can contain This infection [Chorus]Self-isolate with meCome on babySelf-isolate with me Yeah babyI’ve got all the toilet paper You would ever need So self-isolate with me [Verse 2]It’s our duty baby Gotta stop this going around Come up to my room where we can avoid large crowds I think I got a fever But I don’t need a chemist Inside my trousers there’s a national epidemic [Chorus]So self-isolate with meCome on babySelf-isolate with meYeah baby I got all the sanitizer you would ever need So self-isolate with me [Bridge]You heard it in the new Stay inside for even days They banned public performances But private ones are still okay I hear you coughing baby And I can take a hint I shut the borders But I recon I can squeeze you in We gotta do what we can To slow the transmission Because of you I got a pre-existing groin condition We got to hideaway Come on and rest your head I’ll make you feel better about the fact your grandma’s death [Chorus]Self-isolate with me Come on babySelf-isolate with me BabyI got all the cough syrup that you would ever need So self-isolate with me
