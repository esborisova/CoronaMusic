[Verse 1]We are stuck in quarantine I could really use a big canteen Or a nice big beer to wash down No more playing the field of the bar My tinder dates can only go so farNo more third base or stranger I my car That's always the best part [Chorus]But thank god for Netflix and that I had no vacation days left Thank god for all those naked people humping on the internet Hey, thank god for fighting that grandpa for those cancer beans Thank goodness I'm all alone because they made me a fart machine [Spoken words]It's pretty gross [Verse 2]This coronavirus is really getting to me I'm increasingly crying more all alone in my toilet paper [???][Spoken words]I'm all alone [Chorus]I'm trying to follow the Beatles advice to Let it Be After this is over I'm gonna need a hell of therapySo thank god for music and thank god for drugs Thank god for all those jumbo-sized [???] vodka jugs Thank god for dick pictures they help to pass the time You show me yours and I guess I could show you mine I'm in quarantine [Verse 3]How do you pass the time? Oh, I'm slowly going insane I need to smell the familiar body odor on the City train I need human touch one thy grace is just enough This is all so tough after this the single guys better all be buff[Spoken words]At least I know one hand will be [Outro]I'm all alone Just me and my selfphne And me ten new foster cats Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meowMeow, meow√â
