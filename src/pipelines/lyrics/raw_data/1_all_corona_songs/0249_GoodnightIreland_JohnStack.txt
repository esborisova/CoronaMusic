[Verse 1]Corona virusIt came from China It’s here to find usIt’s on our island Now we must fight And do what’s right Cause it’s coming so darn hard to take on our life [Verse 2]They kept it quiet Their stupid dietIf it moves they try it If it’s got eyes they fry it Now the human race Might meet its fate Just because ChinaThey eat bats for entrées[Interlude][Verse 3]There’s cancellations Look at the six nations Liverpool’s tied up Might yet be stifle And Patties Day Just, just washed away And who knows Chapman might befall the same fate [Verse 4]His measures drastic We’ll take these courses Or we’ll leave in plastic As numbered corpsesIt will get dark As dark as night (night, night, night)And we’ll hold onto each other Pass it on to each other Last one left Can you please turn off the light [Chorus]And we will all go down together Yes we will all go down together Yes we will all go down together [Interlude][Verse 5]Alcohol wipes and sanitizer We cannot buy themCause they come from China Stock up on milk Bought all the breadYou may as well have a clean arse when your dead [Bridge]We live through war Through Ebola And SARSAnd now the time has come For everyone To stand aloneAt least for two weeks in isolation It’s what we must do to save our nationAnd we must tryTo stay alive And we did watch all the cases We threw on human races And we waited for this thing to arrive [Chorus]Now we will all go down together We said we’d all go down together Yes, we will all go down together [Outro: spoken]So that’s itStock upBuy the Tea bagsThe milk Toilet paper, vital The breadDon’t forget the alcohol They’d said that alcohol kills it So go down to the shops boys and girls andBy laws of Corona, it’s all rock bottom prizes nowAnd if we’re going down, we may as well go down singingAnd if I don’t make itTell my family that I love them and tell, tell my children that we didn’t bring the fish to the wet That’s, that’s, that’s, that’s just not what happened Stay safe out there everybody Wash your hands, wear gloves, cough into your elbow
