[Verse 1]At first I was afraid, I was petrified Kept thinking I could never teach through Canvas all the time But then I spent so many nights reading the help docs for so long And I grew strong I learned how to get along [Verse 2]And so I’m back The students are gone As all my colleague try to figure out how they’re gonna get along I should have kept up with the tech, not skipped that class on course design If I’d have known for just one second I’d be teaching all-online [Verse 3]Go, now, goLeave me alone I’ve got to figure out just how the lecture using Panopto They gave me two days to adjust to move everything online Did you think I’s crumble Did you think I’d lay down and die[Chorus]Oh, no not II will survive Oh, as long as I know how to Zoom I know I’ll be alive Oh my students still will learn and my paychecks I will earn And I’ll survive I will survive Hey, hey[Verse 4]It took all the strength I had not to lay down and die Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my syllabi And I spend oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry but now I hold my head up high [Verse 5]And you’ll see me Teaching on ZoomBut just don’t cough into the mic Or every eye will be on you I can’t hear you - you’re on muteYour camera’s black – are you still thereWe’ve got some glitches to work out But I know my grading scheme is fair [Verse 6]Oh, now go Walk out that door Trying to get this lecture done And I’m already on take four Now the network has gone down And I’m all out of wine Do you think I’ll crumble Do you think I’ll kay down and die[Chorus]Oh, no not II will survive Oh, as long as I know how to Zoom I know I’ll be alive Oh my students still will learn and my paychecks I will earn And I’ll survive I will survive Hey, hey
