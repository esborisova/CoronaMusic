[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, little darling 
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
It's all right 

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, little darling 
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
It's all right 

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, little darling 
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
It's all right 

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, little darling 
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, little darling 
Here comes the sun

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, little darling 
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, little darling 
Here comes the sun

[Outro]
It's all right
Here comes the sun
