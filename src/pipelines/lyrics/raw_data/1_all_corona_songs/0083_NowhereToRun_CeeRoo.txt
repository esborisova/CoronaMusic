[Chorus]
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby

[Verse 1]
Woke up and I'm feeling depressed
I've got nobody to play chess
Because I know that it's all around
Just keep the distance 
Be careful now
Everywhere I go
I wash my hands 
Everything I touch
I wash my hands
Everything I do
I wash my hands 
With water and soap

[Pre-chorus]
It's all around
We got to be careful
It's all around
We got to be careful
It's all around
We got to be careful
It's all around
We got to be careful

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby

[Bridge]
Keep calm and stay at home 
Keep calm and stay at home 
Keep calm and stay at home
Keep calm and stay at home 
Keep calm and stay at home 
Keep calm and stay at home 
Keep calm and stay at home 
Keep calm and stay at home 

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
Nowhere to run baby
Got nowhere to run to baby
