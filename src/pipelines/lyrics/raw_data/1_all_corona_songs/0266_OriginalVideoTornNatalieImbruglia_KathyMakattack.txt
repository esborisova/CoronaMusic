[Verse 1]So I’m kind of scared of being hereThere’s lots of talking, lots of singingWithout protective gear So all your germs are in the air During SARS I was just a child Didn’t seem to know, seem to careAbout the virus running wild But now I’m freaking out alright [Pre-Chorus]I sterilize, I sanitize My hands are always freaking dry There’s just so many things That I can’t touch [Chorus]I’m torn How do I use the lift How do I get the door I hold on to my bags ‘cause all the germs fall to the floor And when I get the train I’ll stand using my core Because I don’t know Who the hell has touched that pole before I need to hibernate I wanna to go back home [Verse 2]So then I finally went out on the streets After days of being at home And hiding in my sheets But then I start to worry cause There’s nothing left at the grocery store I can’t find bok choy no more There is just white people things [Chorus]Like pasta, cheese and corn Where the hell’s the rice Why’s it there-times the price And when I asked the staffLet’s say she wasn’t very nice There’s dust in my eye But if I touch it I might die I think the only way to get it out is start to cry I need to hibernate I need to go back home Home [Interlude][Pre-Chorus]I sterilize, I sanitize My hands are always freaking dry There’s just so many things That I can’t touch [Chorus]I’m torn How do I use the lift How do I get the door I hold on to my bags cause all the germs fall to the floor When I get the train I’ll stand using my core Because you don’t know who the hell has touched that pole before Where the hell’s the rice Where the hell’s the meat There’s panic in the air Cause there’s no toilet rolls no more We need a little faith We’ll get through this Hong Kong Oh, oh[Solo: Guitar]
