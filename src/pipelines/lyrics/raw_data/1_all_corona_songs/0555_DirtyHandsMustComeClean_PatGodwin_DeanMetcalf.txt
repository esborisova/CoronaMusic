[Verse 1]
If you're having trouble with a common cold
Get yourself to a sink 
Don't want Corona, here's what you gotta do
There's more germs than you think
Turn on the water, make it hotter
Take the doctors advise
No, C O V I D 19
Hey, sing Happy Birthday twice

[Chorus]
Dirty hands must come clean
Dirty hands spread disease 
Dirty hands must come clean
Dirty hand and they must come clean 
Dirty hand and they must come clean 

[Verse 2]
Monkey pox, SARS, ebola
Must come clean
Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C D E

[Chorus]
Dirty hands must come clean
Dirty hands must come clean
