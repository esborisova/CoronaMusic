[Verse 1]
Will this lockdown ever end?
I've got itchy feet again
Cabin fever got me creeping
Out the house while my wife's sleeping
Made a decision that I'd probably make again
Couldn't abstain 
From sneaking out in silence

[Verse 2]
In the streets I walked alone
Finally was on my own
But found myself in a quandary
Promised my wife I'd do the laundry
Walking back when I saw the flash of blue and red lights
That split the night
With the sound of sirens

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten police vans maybe more
They pinned me against the floor
Coppers said I have broken the law
I said, "please let me go, I was just going to the store"
But they ignored
And said I have the right to remain silent

[Verse 4]
Cop said, "brother, don't you know?
At this time the shops are closed"
In the argument I was forming
Forgot it was 2:30 in the morning
My excuses, like silent raindrops fell
A jail cell
Is where I was headed, with sirens

[Verse 5]
And now I'm in the prison hall
The cop said you can make one call
It was the hardest choice of my life
Realized I had to phone my wife
Don't think I had it in my heart
To say the laundry's still not done
I called no one
So I sat in my cell, in silence
