[Verse 1]
I have a dream, a dream of what I wanna be
I want to be free, thats what my heart keeps telling me
Give me your hand, we'll find a way 
There are people out there that feel the same
And if we help each other, I just know we can succeed

[Chorus]
We are one but we are different, we're from all around the world 
We share the sam sun, we share the same oceans 
We are every boy and girl 
Come together and share our dreams 
We'll be among the stars, and we know that it's destiny 
We are unity
We are unity

[Verse 2]
I do believe, oh, I believe in destiny
It's up to me to make it into reality
Give me your hand, we'll find a way  
There are people out there who feel the same
And if we help each other, I just know we can succeed

[Chorus]
We are one but we are different, we're from all around the world 
We share the sam sun, we share the same oceans 
We are every boy and girl 
Come together and share our dreams
We'll be among the stars, and we know that it's destiny 
We are unity 

[Bridge]
No matter where you're from or who you are, if we can find a common place to be 
Then we are friends 
We are one but we are different, we're from all around the world 
We share the same sun, we share the same oceans 

[Chorus]
We are one but we are different, we're from all around the world 
We share the same sun, we share the same oceans 
We are every boy and girl 
Come together and share our dreams 
We'll be among the stars, and we know that it's destiny 
That we are unity 
We are unity
