[Verse 1]Too much to say Too much to lose I get frustrated thinking about the world I brought you to It's a battle of time That I have with you But don't decide the how, the when or if we'll make it through I feel that you deserve a chance to know the truth and to be better than The ones who came before you only to let pride and money weaken them [Chorus]So be the young, the brave, the powerful Cause the world is standing waiting for someone to come and change it Yeah, be the young, the brave, the powerful Cause we need a soul to save us Need someone to be the greatest [Verse 2]So many words Veiling the truth The others turning and it's time for us to choose And people will try To take you down too But if I was a betting man, I'd put all my money on you I know that I have nothing left to give to you to make you better than The man I failed to be, the friends and father that I know I should have been [Chorus]So be the young, the brave, the powerful Cause the world is standing waiting for someone to come and change it Yeah, be the young, the brave, the powerful Cause we need a soul to save us Need someone to be the greatest [Bridge]Nobody knows what to say (oh no) Nobody shows you the way (oh no) Sometimes it's hard to see Who you're gonna be [Chorus]So be the young, the brave, the powerful Cause the world is standing waiting for someone to come and change it Be the young, the brave, the powerful Cause we need a soul to save us Need someone to be the greatest [Chorus]Be the young, the brave, the powerful Cause the world is standing waiting for someone to come and change it Be the young, the brave, the powerful Cause we need a soul to save us Need someone to be the greatest love
