[Chorus]
I want you to stay
Would you stay home with me?
And I don't wanna lose you
Pick up the phone and talk to me right now
I want you home with me, want you home
Would you spend time with me? Come back
I want you home with me
Would you spend time with me?

[Verse 1]
It’s invisible, it’s in the air
Unpredictable, anything could happen
Know you’re not alone
Even when you’re locked in
Together we can stop it

[Verse 2]
Prayer hands up when we're staying inside
For the ones putting their uyir (life) on the line
Manithanukkul kadavul irikindrar
(God is in all of them)
Now’s about what really matters the most
Keep your head high and your kudumbam (family) close
Gotta know ithaiyum naam kadappom
(Gotta know this too shall pass)

[Verse 3]
打 开了眼 呆在家一整天
(I open my eyes I’m staying home again)
戏 看三遍 它的字都会念
(Ive been watching the same shows again and again)
播歌跳舞够力够力
(Play a song and dance to the beat)
屁股扭扭看也看不腻
(Shake that body I don’t get sick of it) 
I’m living the time 在这隔离的时间 I’m counting the minutes to 出门去绕
I’m living the time during the quarantine and I'm counting the minutes to go out again
但 吃的饱 睡得好 喝到妙 还算是 吉多凶少
But we been eating well, sleeping well, drinking well and we count our blessings

[Verse 4]
And oh, I won’t
Wanna live with all that regret
Just wanna get through this
Even if I’m on my own
You know I’ll go
Any distance for them
Better safer than sorry
Don’t want you to worry
For you I’ll come home

[Chorus]
I want you to stay
Would you stay home with me?
And I don't wanna lose you
Pick up the phone and talk to me right now
I want you home with me, I want you home
Would you spend time with me? Come back
I want you home with me
Would you spend time with me?

[Verse 5]
I’m on my way
I’ll be back today
Hey, don’t worry I’ll be by your side
You won’t fight alone
Yeah, I’m coming home
To see you, see you
It’s enough to stay inside
To save some lives, for us to thrive
It’s a long-drawn battle we’re in
But we’re bigger than this, we’re bigger than this

[Verse 6]
Walking in, walking out
Never had to think twice about it out there
Times will change
Yeah, we know
But there’s no need to go crazy 
Think of others, yeah

[Verse 7]
I can lift you up, when you had enough
All u gotta do is come home
Through your sacrifice, through your weary nights
I will hold your hand through it all

[Verse 8]
Semua dah lain, dunia beza
(Everything is different, the world has changed)
Bulan puasa (fasting month) and we got no bazaar
It happened so fast, as long as I’m healthy, aku bersyukur (im grateful)
Yeah we made it this far
And I'll be right here for you

[Verse 9]
出门记得带口罩 (aye) 
(Remember to mask up when you leave the house)
Jangan keluar, 不要乱乱跑 (aye)
(Don’t leave the house unnecessarily)
We can’t wait till it’s too late ‘fore we move baby, so the time is now (aye)
Shoutouts to 我们的 (our) healthcare workers on the frontline
你们为我们的牺牲 (The sacrificed you’ve made for us) always be our minds

[Verse 10]
Spending all my time, just staying at home 
Get through it all, we together alone
Everyone taking a share of the pain
After all we know it won’t be the same
We all got fears
Keep your head high
Don’t shed a tear
After the rain it’ll be clear  
Matter of time before it disappears 

[Verse 11]
Take a deep breath 
Jangan engkau mudah mengalah 
(Dont you give out too easily) 
Percayalah 
(Trust that) 
Semestakan segar lagi 
(The universe will heal again) 

[Verse 12]
Even though stones break the bones 
You will never break the soul 
We’ll be fighting through the cold, mm 
And we’re waiting for you to come home 
You’ll be coming home, mmm

[Chorus]
I want you to stay 
Would you stay home with me? Stay home with me
And I don't wanna lose you 
Pick up the phone and talk to me, right now
I want you home with me, I want you home 
Would you spend time with me? 
I want you home with me, just come home 
Would you spend time with me? 
 
[Outro]
Jangan keluar  
Duduk di rumah
