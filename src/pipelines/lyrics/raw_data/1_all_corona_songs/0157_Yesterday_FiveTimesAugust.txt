[Verse 1]
Yesterday, I could drive around to any place
I could shake your hand and touch my face
And I had Purell yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly, I bought way way too much rice and beans
And toilet paper is now a currency
And we’re all social-distancing

[Chorus]
Where I'd like to go? I don’t know, I couldn’t say
Binge-watched every show ‘cause stores have closed since yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday, all my kids could go outside and play
Now I’m their teacher and don’t know what to say
Oh, public school just yesterday

[Chorus]
Where I'd like to go? I don’t know, I couldn’t say
All my food has run out, I’m not proud, made it just one day

[Verse 4]
Yesterday, everything was basically the same
Wasting time on my phone most the day
But now I see we’re all insane
No more Purell as of today
