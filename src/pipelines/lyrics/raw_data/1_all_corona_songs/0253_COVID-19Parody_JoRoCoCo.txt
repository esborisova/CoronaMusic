[Verse 1]Oh my hands are chappedThey’re red and raw A high five is against the law I have a recipe to make Purell There’s no toilet paper in the stores I use elbows now to open the doorsIt is a lot of work to just stay well[Chorus]Don’t kiss me Don’t smile at me Your mask is all I want to seeJust wave but come no closer than six feetOur world is COVID-19 Our hands have never been so clean We hate this quarantine [Verse 2] So many ways to be on screens So many new Corona memes Who are you people who still socializeHome-office, home-gym and homeschool Even church follows the rule We only leave to make our panic buys [Chorus]Don’t kiss me Don’t smile at me Your mask is all I want to seeJust wave but come no closer than six feetOur world is COVID-19 Our hands have never been so clean We hate this quarantine
