
[Verse 1]
Living with coronavirus 
And our lives are not the same 
No more going out to dinner
No more watching the game 
Your kids are driving you crazy 
But don’t bring them to the park 
Lock seniors in their nursing homes 
But you keep them in your heart 

[Chorus]
Stay away from your neighbors 
Keep six feet apart 
Let’s all do what is needed 
Just stay home and be smart 
Washing hands to Happy Birthday 
We don’t dare touch our face 
Homes stocked with toilet paper 
What’s happened to the human race?

[Solo: guitar]

[Verse 2]
Thanks to all still out there working 
Suck a selfless thing to do 
Protect, treat, and deliver 
They’re doing it just for you 
So remember we are a nation 
That’s always known to be firm 
Let’s kick this virus to the curb 
‘Cause we need never crash and burn 

[Chorus]
Stay away from your neighbors 
Keep six feet apart 
Let’s all do what is needed 
Just stay home and be smart 
Washing hands to Happy Birthday 
We don’t dare touch our face 
Homes stocked with toilet paper 
What’s happened to the human race?

[Solo: guitar]

[Chorus]
Oh, tay away from your neighbors 
Keep six feet apart 
Let’s all do what is needed 
Just stay home and be smart 
Washing hands to Happy Birthday 
We don’t dare touch our face 
Homes stocked with toilet paper 
What’s happened to the human race?
