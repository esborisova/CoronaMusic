[Intro]
Home
Stay at home

[Verse 1]
Look around, everywhere you turn is COVID
It’s everywhere that you go (just look around)
I know you’ve tried, everything you can to escape
This social distance shit show (what a shit show)
But just settle in to the quarantine
Flatten the corona curve
They say the cure is up to you and me
It’s called a sick day, so, bitch, you best stay home

[Chorus]
Come on, stay home (home)
Work remotely and Zoom your meetings (and Zoom your meetings)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, stay home (home)
Watch the TV and eat your feelings (and eat your feelings)
You know you can do it

[Verse 2]
All you need is your own imagination
So use it, that’s what it's for (Chris, tell me more)
Read a book, that’s that thing that’s filled with paper
But I can’t tell you for sure (I can’t say for sure)
It makes no difference if you’re black or white
Corona is coming for you
Do the cool thing now and just stay inside
You’re a hermit star, yes, that’s what you are, you know it

[Chorus]
Come on, stay home (home)
Work remotely and Zoom your meetings
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, stay home (home)
Watch the TV and eat your feelings
You know you can do it

[Bridge]
Home is where the heart is
So forget your friends outside it
First day in feels like magic
But soon you’ll be a bat-shit lunatic
I’ve got to go (oh, my god, get me the fuck out of here)
No! Isolate for the cure

[Chorus]
Stay home (home)
Home is where the heart is (and Zoom your meetings)

[Verse 3]
Netflix, Hulu, HBO
Bachelor and Game of Thrones
Conan, Ellen, QVC
Eat the cover of a magazine
Churn butter, needlepoint
Pick your nose and smoke a joint
Wrap your head up like a nun
PornHub masturbation
Wheel of Fortune, Oprah’s OWN
The Greatest British Baking Show
Modern Family, Shark Tank, too
Grace and Frankie, we love you
Fixer Upper, Will and Grace
Deepak Chopra meditate
Don’t go out there, let’s sit to it
Couch potato, there’s nothing to it
Stay home (home, home, home)
Stay home (home, home, home)

[Chorus]
Ooh, you’ve got to 
Work remotely and Zoom your meetings
Ooh, you’ve got to just
Watch the TV and eat your feelings
Ooh, you’ve got just
Stay home (home, home, home)
