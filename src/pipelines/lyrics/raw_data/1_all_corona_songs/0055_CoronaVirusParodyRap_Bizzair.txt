[Verse 1]
Face mask, yellow pants with the high pockets
Water jugs that we are prepping for coronavirus
I got the cans of chilli stocked up in my apartment 
Hand sani[tizer] on deck, you don't want to start this
Yeah, corona rolled up to the West Coast 
This ain't swine flu, ebola or strep throat
It ain't nothing like we've seen it's an outlier
COVID-19 spreading around like it's wild fire

[Verse 2]
You all, it's locked down in my crib now
You entered the quarantine zone, better sit down
You put us all at risk when you hit this town
I ain't messing around you get the gist now 
Strip down, it's the shower first 
Oh, you brought your girl, homie, I'm gonna check the purse
There ain't anything getting by your boy, get the mask on
Ever since there was an outbreak from the Wuhan

[Verse 3]
Move along, yo, you passed the test
Got a whole lot of toilet paper all in my chest 
For all of you that having been taking coronavirus lightly 
You can kiss these latex gloves, come and fight me
