[Verse 1]There’s too many people in the streets these days Don’t none of you all watch the news We’re supposed to be isolating So what the fuck is wrong with you?I guess spring break is more important Than grandmas life Time to cut the shit and do what’s right [Pre-chorus]It’s like a dream, this quarantine Be as lazy as you want to be Take your ass home Play on your phone Stay there alone [Chorus]Stay at home, stay at homeI’m not gonna tell you this anymore Stay at home, stay at home Go inside and lock the door I don’t care if you feel great Stay the fuck inside You don’t even like people anyway[Verse 2]When they say social distancingIt doesn’t mean go to the mall Whys your dumbass think a lockdown Don’t apply to you at all?[Pre-chorus]It’s time to really face the truth And know that it’s about more than just you!We can save the world By doing one thingNothing [Chorus]Stay at home, stay at home Drink a beer, smoke a blunt or get highStay at home, stay home No one else needs to die I’m not doing this For 18 months Stay the fuck inside![Bridge]Highly contagious doesn’t even slow you down And it might be you that’s infecting people all around I’ll give you one more warning, this will be your last Then I swear I’ll find youAnd I promise I will beat your ass[Chorus]Just stay home, stay at home Why you making this so fucking hard Stay at home, stay at home We want this stupid virus gone You make this worse Each time you’re out Stay the fuck inside It’s not just about you anyway
