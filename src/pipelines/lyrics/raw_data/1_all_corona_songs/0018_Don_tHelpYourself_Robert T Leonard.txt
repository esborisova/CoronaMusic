[Verse 1]
No soap or loo rolls on the shelf 
We need to isolate ourselves
Thats what we’ve all been told to do
Stay indoors, save a few
That’s what I want you to do

[Verse 2]
Boris has said repeatedly
Keep 2 meters between you and me 
Stay home and save the NHS
Or we'll all end up in a mess 
Don't go to Cornwall or Inverness 

[Chorus]
Just wash your hands and thumbs 
Scrub your nails and put on sanitizer, too 
Wear rubber gloves when you open the door, another suggestion for you 
You'll save your health and the elders around you will be safer that is my plea
So don’t help yourself to my lips, to my arms, please stay far away from me 
Alright, yeah 

[Verse 3] 
If we had done what I would do 
We might have got out in a month or two
But now we've been put on lockdown and that really makes me frown because of all you stupid clowns

[Chorus]
Just wash your hands and your thumbs 
Scrub your nails and put on sanitizer, too 
Wear rubber gloves when you open the door, another suggestion for you 
You'll save your health and the elders around you will be safer including me
So don’t help yourself to my lips to my arms please stay far away from me 
Don’t help yourself
Yeah
