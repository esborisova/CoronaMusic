[Verse 1]Shops and schools are shut downFamilies in lockdown Elderly are knocked down tooPeople in depression Businesses in recession Tv's only got bad news[Chorus]We're in quarantine from Covid-19It's more contagious than the flu There’s no vaccine for Covid-19It seems like a bad dream coming true Well, it's 2020Got the Covid-19 blues [Verse 2] Politicians in control Polices are on patrol People are forced to work from home The country's closed for business Keep a social distance We're in this fight together all alone [Chorus]We're in quarantine from Covid-19It's more contagious than the flu There is no vaccine for Covid-19It seems like a bad dream coming true Well, it's 2020Got the Covid-19 blues[Solo: Guitar][Verse 3]We're prisoners in paradise We're learning how to compromise Will life on earth ever be the same To care about the weather 'Cause we're spending time together Eating our rations and playing board games[Chorus]We're in quarantine from Covid-19It's more contagious than the flu There is no vaccine for Covid-19It seems like a bad dream coming true Well, it's 2020Got the Covid-19 blues(Take me home, oh yeah)[Solo: Guitar][Outro]
