[Spoken intro]
Hey, daddy
Play with me
Play with me
I want a snack
Is it bedtime yet?
Play

[Refrain]
Yeah, I got to play all day because the daycare closed
I'm going to cry until I can't no more 
I got to play all day because the daycare closed 
I'm going to cry until I can't no more 
Play with me

[Verse 1]
Hey, I been up since the crack 
Soul is turning black
I'd Venmo all my cash if the school would take my kid back
He rides me like a horse 
Recession took my shorts 
Play Dough, Nemo, finger painting while we stuck up on the porch

[Chorus]
When can all the schools reopen?
When can all the schools reopen?
When can all the schools reopen?
When can all the schools reopen?

[Verse 2]
Daddy make me sandwich
Hold up make that fish sticks 
Go on make me pasta
Put on Daniel Tiger, bitch
My life is a movie
Groundhog Day and Raffi
Volcano so craft
Can I drink this early? Yup

[Chorus]
When can all the schools reopen?
When can all the schools reopen?
When can all the schools reopen?
When can all the schools reopen?

[Refrain]
Yeah, I got to play all day because the daycare closed
I'm going to cry until I can't no more 
I got to play all day because the daycare closed 
I'm going to cry until I can't no more 

[Verse 3]
iPad, ice cream, throw a tantrum and scream
Time out, fifteen minutes 
Thank god, time for HGTV
Baby's got a habit, Blippi, garbage trucks and sports cars 
Riding my last nerve like Cardi B's nails on a chalk board 
So much stress
Bouncy castle's flat
Jesus, take the wheel
Get the teacher's back

[Outro]
Wish I could sleep all day but the daycare closed
I'm going to cry until I can't no more 
I got to play all day because the daycare closed 
I'm going to cry until I can't no more 
I got to play all day because the daycare closed 
I'm going to cry until I can't no more
