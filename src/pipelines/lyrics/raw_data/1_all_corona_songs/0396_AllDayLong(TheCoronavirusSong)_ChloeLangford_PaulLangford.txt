[Chorus]It’s just me, and my euphonium Sitting here, stuck at home-ium Nothing but time to talk on the phone-ium All day long We’re all in this boat on account of corona From here in Mundelein all the way to Sedona We’ve cleaned everything here in my home All day long [Verse 1]We’ve sorted Legos, we’ve played Catan, We’ve ridden scooters, we’ve washed out hands We’ve watched a thousand movies, but not Peter Pan We’ve done e-learning as much as we can stand [Chorus]It’s just me, and my euphonium Sitting here, stuck at home-ium Nothing but time to talk on the phone-ium All day long We’re all in this boat on account of corona From here in Mundelein all the way to Sedona We’ve cleaned everything here in my home All day long [Verse 2]Spending lots of time with my sister I admit, I kind of missed herZoom with my friends, Zoom with my cousins Eating potato chips by the dozen Family walks, drawing with chalk Riding my bike all around the block Aprendiendo Español todo al día[Solo: Trombone][Chorus]It’s just me, and my euphonium Doesn’t take the place of my trombone-ium Both of them keep me from being so lonesome All day long We’re all in this together because of corona From New York City down to Oklahoma I’ve done everything possible here in my home All day longThank you dad, for your assistance Even though we had to social distance Here in our house we work on co-existence All day long All day longAll day long
