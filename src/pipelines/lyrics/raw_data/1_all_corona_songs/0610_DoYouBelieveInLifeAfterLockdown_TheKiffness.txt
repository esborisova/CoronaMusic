[Intro]
After lockdown

[Verse 1]
When this lockdown finally ends
I don't need to see my friends
'Cause I have my phone
I'm happy on my own
I can't bear the thought of leaving
'Cause this time alone has been healing
In quarantine having so much fun
I know I'm not the only one, oh

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after lockdown?
I can deal with being by myself
I really don't think I'm strong enough, oh
To up and leave this life that I love
I can feel that I'm beside myself 
I really don't want to leave my couch, no

[Verse 2]
If we get to level two
I still don't wanna talk to you
We've got Zoom for that
Now there's no turning back
I need time to watch TV
'Cause this life is so easy
I've had time to think it through
This quaran-queen is just too good for you 

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after lockdown?
I can deal with being by myself
I really don't think I'm strong enough, oh
To up and leave this life that I love
I can feel that I'm beside myself 
I really don't want to leave my couch, no

[Bridge]
Well I thought that I wouldn't get through this
But I know that I was wrong
'Cause I don't need drinking anymore
I don't need smoking anymore
I don't need nature anymore
I don't need to party anymore
I actually do need all these things

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after lockdown?
I can deal with being by myself
I really don't think I'm strong enough, oh
To up and leave this life that I love
I can feel that I'm beside myself 
I really don't want to leave my couch, no
Do you believe in life after lockdown?
