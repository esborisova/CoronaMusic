[Verse 1]
So this quarantine is getting out of hand 
And summer’s over before it began 
Everyone is buying all the toilet roll 
You can use a shower to wash your hole 
Stay home only leave to go get food
Look out for the elderly cause that’s what makes you cool  
Don’t go to parties and crash your bloody car
Especially when you’re supposed to be a star 

[Chorus]
It’s quarantine, it made me lose my mind 
But if we all just stick together it will be just fine 
Quarantine, it made me lose my mind 
If we all just stick together it will be just fine

[Verse 2]
Never thought I’d take advise from Piers Morgan
I used to switch him straight off in the morning
But what he says is too blooming true 
Stay away from me, don’t be a fool 
They say no joke, we want it done 
So we can all just go on holiday and have some fun 

[Chorus]
It’s quarantine, it made me lose my mind 
But if we all just stick together it will be just fine 
Quarantine, it made me lose my mind 
If we all just stick together it will be just fine
So put on your gloves, and put on your mask
Don’t buy all the food, you massive set of prats
And thanks to all the workers doing your thing 
We’d be lost without you and all the help you bring 

[Solo: Whistling] 

[Chorus]
It’s quarantine it made me lose my mind 
We all just stick together it will be just fine 
So put on your gloves and put on your mask
Don’t buy all the food, you massive set of prats
Thanks to all the workers doing your thing 
We’d be lost without you and all the help you bring 
This quarantine it made me lose my mind
