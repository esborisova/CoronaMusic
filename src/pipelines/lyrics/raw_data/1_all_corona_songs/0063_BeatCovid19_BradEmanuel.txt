[Verse]
Where it began, somewhere in china 
And now it is here and going strong 
Should slow down by spring, better be gone by summer 
Who would have believed you could pass it along 

[Pre-Chorus]
By hands, so do not touch hands, so do not reach out 
Do not touch me, I will not touch you 

[Chorus]
It is beat Covid one nine, so good times once again are good 
I have been inclined to believe we really could 

[Verse]
So I’m stuck here tonight and it seems all so lonely 
We fill it up with only 2 6 feet apart
And if your head hurts with a dry cough and slight fever 
I would quarantine myself if I were you 

[Pre-Chorus]
Warm, if you feel warm, do not reach out, don’t touch me, I will not touch you 

[Chorus]
Let us beat Covid one nine, so good times once again are good 
I have been inclined to believe we really could 

[Chorus]
Let us beat Covid one nine, so good times once again are good 
Well I have been inclined, to believe we really could 

[Ending Chorus]
Let us beat Covid one nine, so good times once again are good
Well I have been inclined, to believe we really could beat Covid one nine.
