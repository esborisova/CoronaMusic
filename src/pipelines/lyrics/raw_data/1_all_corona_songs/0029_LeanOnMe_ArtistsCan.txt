[Verse 1]
Sometimes in our lives we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow 

[Chorus]
Lean on me
When you’re not strong 
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on 
For it won't be long 
Until I’m gonna need 
Somebody to lean on[Verse 2]
Please swallow your pride if I have things that you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs that you won’t let show

[Break]
You just call on me, brother
When you need a hand 
We all need somebody to lean on 
I just might have a problem that you'd understand 
We all need somebody to lean on

[Chorus]
Lean on me
When you’re not strong 
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on 
For it won't be long 
Until I’m gonna need 
Somebody to lean on

[Bridge]
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand 
'cause we all need somebody to lean on 
On a tous les memes problèmes 
Pour qu’on se comprenne
We all need somebody to lean on  

[Verse 3]
If there is a load that you have to bear 
That you can’t carry 
I am right up the road
I will share your load 
If you just call me 

[Outro]
Call me 
If you need a friend 
Call me 
Call me  
If you need a friend 
You just call me 
Oh, call me 
If you ever need a fried 
Call me 
Call me 
Just call me 
Call me yeah if you need a friend 
Call me
Call me 
Call on me
