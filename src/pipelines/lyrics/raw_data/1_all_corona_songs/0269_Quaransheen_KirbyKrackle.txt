[Verse 1]
Get up at six
Pour me some [???]
Maybe some Trix 
And then a cup of tea
Brushing my teeth 
Out on the street 
Baby, not me 
I'm stuck in Quarantine
Suck it up, man 
You can swallow your pride 
Your only job now is to stay inside

[Verse 2]
Playing guitar 
Not going far 
Eat candy bars 
What am I doing here 
Watching tv 
Watching tv 
Watching tv 
I see a pattern here
Waving out the window 
To the passers by 
Don't know the day 
But it ends in Y

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't daydream 
'Bout the world outside, everywhere I'm gonna eat 
Pizza again third time this week, this week, this week 
Not a day goes by that I don't daydream 
'Bout high fiving every single person that I see 
Got a special kind of glow till they find a vaccine

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Wearing my mask 
Don't want to ask 
For you to step back 
I'm talking six feet 
Taking a walk 
Around the block 
If you walk up 
I'm crossing the street
Not that hard 
Didn't ask for a dance 
I'm out here 
Trying to save you grams and your gramps

[Verse 4]
PB&J 
Every day 
I made it ok 
(I make it perfect now)
Washing my hands 
Washing my hands 
Washing my hands 
And yeah, they're cracking now 
Not gonna leave 
When they open it up 
No beta test here 
Though I need a haircut 
(I need a haircut) 

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't daydream 
'Bout the world outside, everywhere I'm gonna eat 
Pizza again third time this week, this week, this week
Not a day goes by that I don't daydream 
'Bout high fiving every single person that I see 
Got a special kind of glow till they find a vaccine
