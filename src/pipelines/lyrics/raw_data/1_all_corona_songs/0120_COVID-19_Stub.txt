[Intro]
COVID-19
COVID-19

[Verse 1]
Poor Old Alex A
Went to China just two weeks ago
Got back and thought he had the mono
His mother cried
Watched the news, who’d blame her
You’re frail (you’re frail now)
So frail (so frail now)
A diagnosis you’d thought you’d get never
Flu, not flu, not flu, not flu, ayy
Short breath, a cough, and fever

[Chorus]
COVID-19
Diagnose (this disease)
At this moment
You’re in quarantine
You can’t get dressed
Because (you’re a mess)
Hands were dirty
Oh, COVID-19

[Interlude]
COVID-19

[Verse 2]
These people around here
Were on a cruise
but now have masked-up face
Have no idea what their fate is
But not us (no, not us)
No not us (no, not us)
Washing our hands now more than ever
Wash our hands with soap and water, too
Sing the Birthday Song forever

[Chorus]
COVID-19
Diagnose (this disease)
Ah, come on let’s
Call the CDC
That nice, pretty nurse
COVID (it’s the worst)
She’s a bit terse
Ah, COVID-19
That nice, pretty nurse
COVID (it’s the worst)
She’s a bit terse
Ah, COVID-19

[Bridge]
COVID-19, it’s not the flu
COVID-19, it’s not the flu      
Now you’re full-blown
Now you have shown 
COVID-19
Say COVID-19
These symptoms are real and I know 
How you feel
Now I must say more than ever
You'll be in for weeks
COVID’s not the flu
It’s not the flu
        
[Chorus]
COVID-19
Now it’s at (level three)
At this moment
Upsets everything
South by Southwest
Was canceled (the mess)
In a hurry
Oh, COVID-19

[Chorus]
COVID-19
Has shut down (industry)
At this moment
You can’t cruise the seas
So book a flight west
Because (airfare is less)
Pop for first-class
Oh, COVID-19

[Chorus]
COVID-19
Diagnose (this disease)
At this moment
You’re in quarantine
