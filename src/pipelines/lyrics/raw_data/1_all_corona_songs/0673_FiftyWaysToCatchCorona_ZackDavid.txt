[Verse 1]
The problem is all inside your head, she said to me
The answer is easy, if you listen carefully
I’d like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to catch Corona

[Verse 2]
She said, I really hate to give such attitude
Furthermore, I truly hope my social distance isn’t rude
But I’ll repeat myself, at the risk of virus in my food
There must be fifty ways to catch corona
Fifty ways to catch corona

[Chorus]
You just go out to eat, Pete
Hang out at the pub, Bub
Hands don’t need to be clean, Gene
Just listen to me
Breathe in the sneeze, Louise
Don’t worry about that moist breeze
Just touch on your face, Grace
And share a ciggy with me

[Chorus]
Oh, just go out to eat, Pete
Hang out at the pub, Bub
Hands don’t need to be clean, Gene
It’s all cool, you see
Breathe in the sneeze, Louise
Don’t worry about that moist breeze!
Just touch on your face, Grace
Let’s share this ice cream

[Verse 3]
She said, it’s all a hoax, that nasty infectious curve
And forget about this social distance, if you have the nerve
I said, "I appreciate your advice?
But could you please explain about the fifty ways"

[Verse 4]
She said, "why don’t we both just party hard tonight"
No respirators needed anywhere in sight
And then she coughed into my mouth, and I knew that she was right
There must be fifty ways to catch corona
Fifty ways to catch corona

[Chorus]
You just go out to eat, Pete
Hang out at the pub, Bub
Hands don’t need to be clean, Gene
Just listen to me
Breathe in the sneeze, Louise
Don’t worry about that moist breeze
Just touch on your face, Grace
And share a ciggy with me

[Chorus]
Oh, just go out to eat, Pete
Hang out at the pub, Bub
Hands don’t need to be clean, Gene
It’s all cool, you see
Breathe in the sneeze, Louise
Don’t worry about that moist breeze
Just touch on your face, Grace
Let’s share this ice cream
