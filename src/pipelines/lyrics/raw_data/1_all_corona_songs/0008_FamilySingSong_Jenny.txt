[Verse]
The world is big and scary but I love you very much 
The world is big and crazy so for now we cannot touch 
But love is bigger than the mess and wider than the sky
I’ll love you now forever and beyond the day I die

[Verse]
So hug yourself real tight and I will hug myself back too
There will always be a place for you no matter what you do
So hug yourself real tight and I will hug myself back too
I’ll pretend my arms are yours and know that I love you
