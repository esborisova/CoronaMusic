[Intro]Three weeks ago coronavirus didn’t bother me My life was rather nice, I hugged my friends and my family But three weeks on, the world is different COVID-19 has gone worldwide and all I know is I’m going to listen when people tell me to stay inside I’ll stay inside [Verse 1]Well times they are a little strange and we don’t know what to do Coronavirus has broken out now New Zealand has got it too The world has come to a standstill and some folks are going mad But there’s a couple things we all can do to stop this getting really fucking bad [Verse 2]Keeping social distance is the way we stop the spread Cause even though you might not get that sick your grandma might drop dead So think of someone else for once, use what you gotta do Every scientist and expert has just piece of advice to give to you[Chorus] Stay inside, stay alone and stay inside Wash your hand and then just hide Cancel that dinner date, don’t be a dick, self-isolate inside Cause Jacinda wouldn’t lie and she’s sayingThat this awful virus will find it much harder to find us if we stay inside [Verse 3]You do not need to stock your shelves with enough food for a year And it’s not a shortage of toilet paper that should be the problem here Just wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and cough into your arm Maintaining physical distance is the best way we can minimize the harm [Chorus]And Stay inside, with Purell freshly applied  And a personal bobble to meters wide Watching Netflix, read a book, take up knitting, learn to cook inside Though it feels like you might go crazy Boredom is a small price to pay if you can make this go away So stay inside [Bridge]So now you know what you have to do Don’t try and say you don’t We won’t believe, you know we wont Let’s all agree, you stay away from me I’ll stay away from you [Verse 4]Well times they are al little strange but we know what to do We’ll stay inside to stay alive and we will all get through Us kiwis are resilient and its out biggest challenge yet But some pretty simple steps can help us deal to this existential threat  [Chorus]Stay inside, pretty easy to abide unless you prefer that we all die Don’t be a link in the chain, I’ve said before I’ll say it again stay inside Everybody nationwide I’m sayingThese are just some helpful tips to get through the apocalypseOur spirits do not have to be as [???] as the economy The virus cannot win if you maintain a healthy grin and stay inside
