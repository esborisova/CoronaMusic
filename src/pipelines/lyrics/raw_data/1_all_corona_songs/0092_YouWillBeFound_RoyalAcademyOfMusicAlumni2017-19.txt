[Verse 1]
Have you ever felt like nobody was there?
Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere?
Have you ever felt like you could disappear?
Like you could fall, and no one would hear?

[Verse 2]
So, let that lonely feeling wash away
Maybe there's a reason to believe you'll be okay
Because when you don't feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand

[Pre-chorus]
And oh, someone will coming running
And I know, they'll take you home

[Chorus]
Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
And when you're broken on the ground
You will be found
So let the sun come streaming in
Because you'll reach up and you'll rise again
Lift your head and look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found

[Spoken]
Thank you to the heroes of the NHS, who are working tirelessly to save lives 
A huge thank you to the scientists out there that are trying to find a vaccine
And to everyone on the front line, thank you for your selfless commitment 
You are amazing and we love you so much and we are very grateful to have you in this country

[Verse 3]
There's a place where we don't have to feel unknown
And every time that you call out
You're a little less alone
If you only say the word
From across the silence your voice is heard
Someone will come running
To take you home
To take you home  
Someone will come running
To take you home
To take you home  
To take you home 

[Chorus]
Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
When you're broken on the ground
You will be found
So let the sun come streaming in
Because you'll reach up and you'll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found, you will be found
You will be found, you will be found
You will be found

[Bridge]
Out of the shadows
The morning is breaking
And all is new, all is new
It's filling up the empty
And suddenly I see that
All is new, all is new
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone, you are not alone
You are not alone, you are not alone
You are not
You are not alone, you are not alone

[Chorus]
Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need someone to carry you
When you're broken on the ground
You will be found
So when the sun comes streaming in
Because you'll reach up and you'll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found
Even when the dark comes crashing through
You will be found
When you need someone to carry you
You will be found
You will be found

[Outro]
You will be found
