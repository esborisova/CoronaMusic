[Verse 1]
On solid fuel and wires
Turn the key and light the fires
We're leaving Earth today
This rocket's burning bright
We'll soon be out of sight
And orbiting in space

[Pre-chorus]
Pushed back in my seat
Look out my window
There goes home
That brilliant ball of blue
Houses everybody anybody ever knew

[Outro]
So, sing your song, I'm listening
Out where stars are glistening
I can hear your voices bouncing off the moon 
If you could see our nation
From the International Space Station
You'd know why I want to get back soon, get back soon

[Verse 2]
Eighteen thousand miles an hour
Fuelled by science and solar power
The ocean's racing past
At half a thousand tons
Ninety minutes, moon to sun
A bullet can't go half as fast

[Pre-Ccorus]
Floating from my seat
Look out my window
There goes home
That shiny ball of blue
Is where I'm from and also where I'm going to

[Chorus]
So sing your song, I'm listening
Out where stars are glistening
I can hear your voices bouncing off the moon
If you could see our nation
From the International Space Station
You'd know why I want to get back soon (get back soon)

[Bridge]
All black and white just fades to gray 
Where the sun rises sixteen times a day 
You can't make out borders from up here
Just a spinning ball within a tiny atmosphere

[Pre-chorus]
Pushed back in my seat
Look out my window
Here comes home 
What once was fueled by fear
Now has fifteen nations orbiting together here

[Chorus]
So sing your song, I'm listening
Out where stars are glistening
I can hear your voices bouncing off the moon
If you could see our nation
From the International Space Station
You'd know why I want to get back soon, get back soon

[Outro]
You'd know why I want to get back soon (get back soon)
You'd know why I want to get back soon (getting back to you, getting back to you)
Yeah, you'd know why I want to get back soon
You'd know why I want to get back soon
