[Verse 1]
Where it began, I can't begin to knowing 
But then I know it's growing strong
Was in the spring 
And spring became the summer 
Who'd have believed you'd come along 

[Pre-chorus]
Hands, washing hands 
Reaching out
Don't touch me
I won't touch you

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would 
But not I

[Verse 2]
Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely 
We filled it up with only two
And when I hurt 
Hurting runs off my shoulders 
How can I hurt when I'm holding you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands, washing hands 
Reaching out
Don't touch me
I won't touch you

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would 
Sweet Caroline
