[Intro]
Is this still real life? 
Is this still happening? 
Stuck in this lockdown
No escape from 2020
Don’t socialise
As cases still rise sadly
I’m just a poor boy
Can’t see my family 
Because of greedy men, big egos
Had no plan, now we know
We look out our windows 
The curve still isn’t flatter sadly, sadly 

[Verse 1]
Mama, I just killed a man
I didn’t stay inside in bed
Forced to got to work instead 
Mama, life was so much fun
But 2020 took it all away
Mama, I didn’t mean to make them die 
If we don’t have vaccines this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if people didn’t matter 

[Verse 2]
Too late
Our time has come 
Rent payments are behind
We’re so anxious all the time 
Goodbye, everybody
What is left to do?
I’ve got to leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, just look outside our window
I don’t want to die
I sometimes think we won’t even see the fall

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette with tiny hands 
We’ve got proof, we’ve got proof
Didn’t even have a plan though
The CDC was right
It’s very, very frightening me 
New Gestapo, new Gestapo, new Gestapo, new Gestapo 
New Gestapo infiltrates
Now we’re protesting police brutality
And praying that forced opening of schools is no calamity 
Spare us our rights from this monstrosity 
Every race, take a stand
Will you take a stand? 
Bismillah! No, we will not take a stand 
Take a stand 
Bismillah! We will not take a stand 
Take a stand 
Bismillah! We will not take a stand 
Take a stand, will not take a stand
Take a stand 
Never never take a stand, never no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia 
Mama mia, take a stand 
This facism has a jail cell put aside for me
For me, for me

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stop me and just cuff my hands? 
So you just pepper spray us to not meet demands 
Oh baby, can’t do this to me, baby 
Just got to get out, just got to get out of this year 

[Outro]
oh yeah, oh yeah 
And black lives really matter
Everyone should see 
Black lives really matter
Black lives really matter to me
Hit the streets and then vote
