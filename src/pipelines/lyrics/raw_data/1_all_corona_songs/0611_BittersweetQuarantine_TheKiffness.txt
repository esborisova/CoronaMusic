[Verse 1]
Well, it's a bittersweet 
Quarantine, that's life
Trying to make ends meet
People losing their jobs, some will die
This is the strangest road 
Humanity's ever been down
But it's the one that could take us
To places in our mind that we need, yeah

[Chorus]
No change, we can change
We can change, we can change
If we stay in our homes
I am here in my home
'Cause we are 7 billion people
From one thing to the next
We can change our mold
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Well, I never pray
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
Maybe I needed a pandemic
To recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the self-isolation
Cleanse my mind, I feel free now
And the Earth is clean
'Cause there's nobody polluting the streets now

[Chorus]
No change, we can change
We can change, we can change 
If we stay in our homes
I am here in my home
'Cause we are 7 billion people
From one thing to the next
We can change our mold 
No, no, no, no, no
