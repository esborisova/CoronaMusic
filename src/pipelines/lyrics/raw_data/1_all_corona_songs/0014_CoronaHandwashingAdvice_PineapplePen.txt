[Chorus]
I have a hand, I have a soap 
Wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash

[Chorus]
I have a soap, I have a hand 
Wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash
wash wash wash wash

[Outro]
Clean hand, clean hand
Pray for people and peace
We will win
