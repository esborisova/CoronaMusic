[Verse 1]We’re going backswords, yeah, we’re falling down Walking the streets and there’s no one around We’re losing time and now we’re losing sleepSeems like the world is stuck inside with COVID-19 [Pre-chorus]And I’m pretty sure that I’m not the only one that feels like there’s nowhere to hideAnd nowhere to run I’m pretty sure that all my friends are getting wasted on someone Everybody’s lost and scared of who they’ll really become [Chorus]I wish there was a way out I wish we all could just be fine again Don’t want the world to fall down I wish that I could feel alive again Feel alive again [Verse 2]I’m going crazy stuck in quarantine Going through the motions like a machine Say goodbye to the American dream ‘Cause the world is stuck inside with COVID-19[Pre-chorus]And I’m pretty sure that some stupid kid is telling lies Making jokes, saying goodbye like they don’t give a damn I’m pretty sure that all my friends are getting wasted on someone Everybody’s lost and scared of who they’ll really become [Chorus]I wish there was a way out I wish we all could just be fine again Don’t want the world to fall down I wish that I could feel alive again Feel alive again I wish that I could feel alive again I just wanna feel alive again
