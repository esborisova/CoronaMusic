[Chorus]
Thank you 
For doing all the crucial things
You all keep the world going
Thank you for leaving home when it's scary
And for doing your job 
And always carrying on
For all your selfless behavior
For keeping us safer
You couldn't be braver
Thank you
Without all of you
What the heck would we do?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I know that being in here sucks
And we're crammed in our homes and driving everybody nuts
But this is not the time to complain or be hateful
This is the time to be downright grateful
You see the signs in the window panes
And the chalkboard thank you's in the driveway
So yeah, we figured out it's time we sang
About the brave people out there doing their thing
Thank you to the grocer and the garbageman 
Thank you to the teachers making online plans
Thank you to the driver for Amazon Prime
You've got a lot of boxes and they're mostly mine
Thank you to whoever keeps the internet going
Seriously, that's essential and all of us know it
If the signal drops everyone of us is gonna be losing it
'Cause 24/7 everyone of us is using it
Thank you volunteers helping those in need
Thank you people making sure that everyone can eat
Thank you all for donating to the food banks
Lots of people need it, so seriously thanks
Thank you to the restaurants who still make us food
The curbside pickup put us in a good mood
Thank you to the firefighters, please keep coming
'Cause we're all trying to cook and so we're bound to burn something

[Chorus]
Thank you
For doing all the crucial things
You all keep the world going
Thank you for leaving home when it's scary
And for doing your job 
And always carrying on
For all your selfless behavior
For keeping us safer
You couldn't be braver
Thank you
Without all of you
What the heck would we do?

[Verse 2]
Thank you factory workers making PPE
Thank you truck drivers shipping out necessities
Thank you anyone who's streaming a free class
You're making it easier to get off our butts
Thanks hospitals working overtime
All day and night you put your life on the line
Thank you anyone working in skilled nursing
Thank you scientists trying to beat this damn thing
Thank you those watching this from matter where
Maybe you're watching in your underwear
If so, it's all good, we're just glad you're staying home
I know that we're apart, but nobody is alone

[Chorus]
Thank you 
For doing all the crucial things
You all keep the world going
Thank you for leaving home when it's scary
And for doing your job 
And always carrying on
For all your selfless behavior
For keeping us safer
You couldn't be braver
Thank you
Without all of you
What the heck would we do?
