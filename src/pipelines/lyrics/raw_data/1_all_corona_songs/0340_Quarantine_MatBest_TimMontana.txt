[Interlude]	[Verse 1]Went to the grocery store After the stampedePeople fight for toilet paper Like the Ultimate Fighting ChampionshipNothing left in that shelf But a lonely can of beans So I guess I’ll head backTo the house and take a bath in bleach [Chorus]Quarantine, quarantineDrinking whiskey like vaccine Waving at the neighborsSocial distancing Quarantine, quarantineWearing Lysol like sunscreen Quarantine, quarantineOh, lonesome quarantine [Interlude][Verse 2]All my anti-hunting buds Are reaching out to me I know your freezers stay stocked up Can I get some fresh deer meatWell I hope your family is well Hope them hands are clean Any change that you might have an extra AR-15[Chorus]Quarantine, quarantineDrinking whiskey like vaccine Waving at the neighborsSocial distancing Quarantine, quarantineWearing Lysol like sunscreen Quarantine, quarantineOh, lonesome quarantine [Interlude[Bridge]Shout out the heroes fighting this disease It’s time to come together nowThis one’s a [???]Wait a minute [Spoken words]I’m, stop, stop, stop I meant that in like a metaphorical sense not a literal sense because if it came together that would be the antithesis of what quarantine means but good thing, we have Facetime cause we can hang out, make dumb songs like this and shout out to all the health care workers out there, and Tim I really like the chorus let’s hit that one more time.  [Chorus]Quarantine, quarantineDrinking whiskey like vaccine Waving at the neighborsSocial distancing Quarantine, quarantineWearing Lysol like sunscreen Quarantine, quarantineOh, lonesome quarantine [Interlude]
