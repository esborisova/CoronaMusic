[Verse 1]
I've been sitting at the border of love
When dots connect and there's an order above
And there is no one that can touch me
When it's the same thing coming again
I feel I got to say

[Chorus]
I'm gonna walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart
I'm gonna to walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the bottom of your heart

[Verse 2]
Walking hour after hour, if I could
Just use a walking superpower, I would
I'd use it just to come and find you
Then it's the slow and steady again
Never going away

[Chorus]
I'm gonna walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart
I'm gonna to walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the bottom of your heart
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the bottom of your heart
To the bottom of your heart
Heart, heart
Heart, heart
Heart, heart

[Bridge]
If It's a puzzle I can solve, I'll find a way
To find you, I wouldn't mind to
And I will muscle my resolve and every day
I'm walking away, I'm never gonna stray

[Chorus]
I'm gonna walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart
I'm gonna walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart

[Chorus]
I'm gonna walk
I won't quit
Until I get
To the bottom of your heart
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the bottom of your heart
To the bottom of your
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the bottom of your heart
To the bottom of your heart
