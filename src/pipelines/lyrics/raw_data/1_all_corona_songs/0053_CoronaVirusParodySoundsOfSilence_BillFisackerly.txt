[Verse 1]
Hello darkness my old friend 
I've come to talk with you again
Because a sickness softly creeping 
Left its germs while I was sleeping 
And the illness that was planted in my nose, now it grows
It is coronavirus 

[Verse 2]
In restless days I walked alone
The empty streets 'cause all stayed home
Beneath the order of the CDC
To stay at least six feet away from me
When my face was hit by the rash of a random sneeze 
Oh goodness, please
Touched by coronavirus

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People rushing without speaking
People buying without thinking 
People hoarding with no intent to share
How is that fair?
Because coronavirus 

[Verse 4]
"Fools!", said I, you do not know
Panic like a cancer grows 
Hear my words that I might teach you
Wash your hands so it cannot reach you
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
Oh what the [hell]
Stupid coronavirus 

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the stockpiles they had made
While Facebook flashed to all a big warning 
With all the falsehoods that were forming 
And the news said: 
The words of the experts are spoken as clear as day 
Stay away
Let's end coronavirus 

[Outro: spoken]
Wash your hands
