[Chorus]
I need toilet paper, toilet paper, toilet paper
I'm out of toilet paper, it's my corona
I need toilet paper, toilet paper, toilet paper
I'm out of toilet paper, it's my corona

[Verse 1]
Got to make a grocery run, well that sounds fun
Why am I out here risking my life, corona?
Where is a goddamn parking space?
Shit, I touched my face
Wait, I think I finally caught my corona!
Stop it, don't be manic, go inside, no organic
Oh no, all GMO, Jesus Christ, now I panic
I'll die, whoa!

[Bridge]
m-m-m, my corona
I'm out of toilet paper, it's my corona

[Verse 2]
Don't come any closer, huh, I'll mess you up, huh!
I'm just coming in for some wipes, corona
Kroger's full of empty shelves
Oh what the hell
Guess I'm stocking up on boxed wine, corona
Nothing's making sense, no more friends, no more basketball
Kids are home from school, it's raining too, and I'm losing my
Mind, whoa!

[Chorus]
m-m-m, my corona!
m-m-m, my corona!
I need toilet paper, toilet paper, toilet paper (Purell)
I'm out of toilet paper, it's my corona (and toilet paper)
I need toilet paper, toilet paper, toilet paper (Clorox, yeah!)
I'm out of toilet paper, it's my corona

[Verse 3]
When you gonna get to me, get to me?
Is it just a matter of time, corona?
Will I kill my family in quarantine! (Yep!)
Or is it just a game in my mind, corona?
Then there's Donald Trump, what the fuck!
Why you shaking hands and keep telling us nothing's up
That we're gonna be fine

[Chorus]
M-m-m, my corona
My, y-y-y-y, whoa!
I need toilet paper, toilet paper, toilet paper (M-m-m, my corona)
I'm out of toilet paper, it's my corona (So sick of my corona)
I need toilet paper, toilet paper, toilet paper(M-m-m, my corona)
I'm out of toilet paper, it's my corona 
I need toilet paper, toilet paper, toilet paper
I'm out of toilet paper, it's my corona
