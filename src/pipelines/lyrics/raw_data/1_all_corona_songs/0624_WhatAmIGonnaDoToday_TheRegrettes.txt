[Chorus]
What am I gonna do today 
Is it gonna slip away 
I don’t want it to 
Whatever we do 
As long as it's with you 
As long as it's with you

[Verse 1] 
Both of us are always waiting 
For a time with nothing in our way 
Both of us anticipating 
For a day that can turn into tomorrow 
Without saying goodbye 

[Chorus]
What am I gonna do today 
Is it gonna slip away
I don’t want it to
Whatever we do
As long as it's with you
As long as it's with you

[Chorus]
What am I gonna do today 
Is it gonna slip away 
I don’t want it to 
Whatever we do 
As long as it's with you 
As long as it's with you 

[Verse 2]
When you come home, what do you see 
Is it the same for you as it is for me 
Are you lost, are you cold 
Is it a day that can turn into tomorrow 
Without saying goodbye 
 
[Chorus]
What am I gonna do today 
Is it gonna slip away 
Well, I don’t want it to 
Whatever we do 
As long as it's with you 
As long as it's with you 
 
[Bridge]
Come to me now 
Come on now 
Come to me now
Come on won’t you
Come to me now 
Come on now 
Come to me now
Come on now
Come on now
 
[Chorus]
What am I gonna do today 
Is it gonna slip away 
I don’t want it to 
Whatever we do 
As long as it's with you 
As long as it's with you 

[Chorus]
What am I gonna do today 
Is it gonna slip away 
I don’t want it to 
Whatever we do 
As long as it's with you 
As long as it's with you 
What am I gonna do
