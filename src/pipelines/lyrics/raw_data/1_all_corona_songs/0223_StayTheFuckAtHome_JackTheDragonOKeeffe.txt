[Verse 1]The world has caught a virus, so I’ve written you a poem We need your help to cure it, so stay the fuck at home And if you have got twelve kids or you’r living on your own Lock it down and isolate and stay the fuck at home If you think you’re not at rick here you’re living in a dome It spreads faster than a hooker’s legs, so stay the fuck at home [Verse 2]I need the gym, I need the beach, I hear you bitch and moan You need to grow a braincell and stay the fuck at home But I feel fine, I don’t feel sick I’ll go out on my own I’ll think of you, you selfish prick Please just stay the fuck at home [Verse 3]From LA through to Berlin From Wuhan through to Rome There’s people dying every day so stay the fuck at home If you need to contact family use Facebook, Skype, iPhone We’ve got the fucking internet so stay the fuck at home [Verse 4]The only way to slow it down is isolate not roam Please help the world get back on track and stay the fuck at home Stay the fuck at home, stay the fuck at home Don’t you be a fucking dick please, stay the fuck at home Stay the fuck at home
