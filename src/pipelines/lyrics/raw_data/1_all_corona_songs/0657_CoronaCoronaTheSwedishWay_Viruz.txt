[Verse 1]
Have you got a virus?
Are you feeling weak?
Tired of being lonely
Home week after week
Just do like the Swedes do
When they fight a disease

[Chorus]
Corona, Corona
Corona, Corona
We fight the Corona
The Swedish way

[Verse 2]
We keep on working
And walk around the street
'Cause we are used to taking
Our responsibility
And of course we don't live
With our elderly

[Chorus]
Corona, Corona
Corona, Corona
We fight the Corona
The Swedish way

[Verse 3]
So why start hoarding
Toilet paper, guns and facial masks
Why close down boarders
That's all we ask
'Cause we believe in this guy
Taking care of the task

[Chorus]
Corona, Corona
Corona, Corona
We fight the Corona
The Swedish way

[Bridge: Spoken word]
Are you feeling bored
Are you going insane
Is this whole virus thing
Playing with your brain
COVID-19 is all new to the world
So you just have to listen to your governments words
Of course apart from Donald Trump
'Cause he's just too dumb
I have a dream that we shall overcome
So let's do this the Swedish way
And let's dance the virus away

[Solo: Saxophone]

[Spoken Word]
But don't forget to keep the distance

[Verse 4]
Do you want a drink
And something to eat
Let's meet at the corner
Just down the street
Where Swedes sing together
Let's fight the disease

[Chorus]
Corona, Corona
Corona, Corona
Let's fight the Corona
The Swedish way
Corona, Corona
Corona, Corona
Let's fight the Corona
The Swedish way
The Swedish way
The Swedish way
The Swedish way
