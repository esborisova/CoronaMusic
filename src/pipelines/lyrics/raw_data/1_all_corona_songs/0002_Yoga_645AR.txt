[Chorus]
So much stacks just like Soulja
We them niggas and they told you
We some shooters, popping like soda
I got racks, they stretching like yoga
Big ass Glock, it got a beam
Body drop, it's dropping like lean
Love that smoke, I am a fiend

[Verse]
Talk to racks because they talk back
I got bundles just like Stacks’
Ran up a check quick like four flat
You ain't gang, you get that tax 
Playing with squad, you going get whacked 
On that bullshit, don't know how to act
It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't 
Try me, this chop hit that boy with the bang
Chopper ain't got a heart, give a fuck what you think
Just hit the lick, now I sip drank
Big ass Glock, it makes them plank
Hammer and that bitch go bang 
In the field, my nuts, they hang

[Chorus]
So much stacks just like Soulja
We them niggas and they told you
We some shooters, popping like soda
I got racks, they stretching like yoga
Big ass Glock, it got a beam
Body drop, it's dropping like lean
Love that smoke, I am a fiend

[Chorus]
So much stacks just like Soulja
We them niggas and they told you
We some shooters, popping like soda
I got racks, they stretching like yoga
Big ass Glock, it got a beam
Body drop, it's dropping like lean
Love that smoke, I am a fiend
