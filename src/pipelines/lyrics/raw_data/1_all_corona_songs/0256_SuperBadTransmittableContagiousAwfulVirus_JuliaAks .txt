[Verse 1]Now, when a virus comes along thatŐs spreading like a plague And Potus and his lackeys have been nothing if not vagueWell then youŐve got to trust the CDC and listen well Unless you want to bid our free society farewell [Chorus]There is a super bad transmittable contagious awful virus And if we donŐt act quick and social distance it will mire us In a stretch of quarantine that lasts until JulyA super bad transmittable contagious awful virus	And if you gotta better cough in your arm And if you gotta better *cough*[Verse 2]Now, back in 1919 influenza had its run But half the docks were busy overseas with World War One Today we have mass media and scientists to say If you donŐt want this virus well then stay six feet away [Chorus]Super damn important that we practice isolation Cause weŐre asymptomatic while itŐs in incubation WeŐll overwhelm our hospitals if thereŐs not mitigation Super damn important that we practice isolation If we donŐt do it then weŐre all gonna die If we donŐt do it then weŐre all gonna die [Verse 3]And so I hope at least you take this lesson here to heart Cause itŐs already scary and weŐre only at the start If you got bores just think of the immunocompromised Who canŐt go much of anywhere unless itŐs sterilized [Chorus]Oh, super bad transmittable contagious awful virus And if we donŐt act quick and social distance it will mire us In a stretch of quarantine that lasts until JulyA super bad transmittable (super bad transmittable)super bad transmittable contagious awful virus super bad transmittable contagious awful virus
