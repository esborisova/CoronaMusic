[Intro]
It's vaccination day
It's vaccination day
It's vaccination day

[Verse 1]
Appointments are open, I'm group four
I don't have to stay here anymore
I'm sick of eating takeout on these plates
The time indoor has got me stressed
But I just checked on CVS
Finally they're giving me some dates
I'll see actual real-life people
It'll be totally strange
I might even get to go see a game

[Chorus]
For the first time in forever
I'll hang out with someone else
Love you
But for the first time in forever
I won't watch sports for myself
'Cause you don't like sports, you know
I could go to a bar with buddies
You're the best
I don't have to live in fear
Love you
For the first time in forever
I won't be right here

[Spoken word]
Guys, I'm really proud of you in quarantine, 'cause you worked really hard
And honey, our relationship has gotten a lot tighter now that we've been in closer space
Bye

[Verse 2]
I'll sit in a seat that cramps my knees
And I won't care 'cause at least I'm free
But then I'm going to an indoor place
I'll be that guy who shows the bar
My brand new vaccination card
And then I'll shove some sushi in my face
Yeah, I know it'll take like six weeks
Till I'm totally immune
But I am getting out of here real soon 

[Chorus]
For the first time in forever
I can see my dad and mom
For the first time in forever
All my fear of death is gone
'Cause when you have asthma it's scary
But in like 40 days
For the first time in forever
I think I'll be okay

[Spoken word]
Kim, I heard you got your vaccine
Where are you?
Oh, there you are

[Verse 3]
Don't let them in
You want tacos?
Don't let them see
Tacos, Kim
She actually didn't mind this quarantine
Let's just drive around and talk
Conceal
Kim?
Don't feel
Come on
Put on a show
She actually doesn't want to go
Oh, come on hon', we'll go to the bar
But she can't always be here
She can't always be here
She cannot live in fear
She cannot live in fear
She may actually put on a brassiere
Brassiere

[Chorus]
For the first time in forever
She will get a pedicure
For the first time in forever
Time away will be good for her
Even though she's introverted
There's really zero doubt
For the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
She'll actually go out
