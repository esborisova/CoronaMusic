[Verse 1]
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
TikTok, Grubhub
Twinks, jocks, bears, cubs
Zoom is the new club
Six feet, no hugs
Still beat these mugs
Sick beat, got a rug
Joe Exotic is a thug
Kitty cat cat, tell me Carole Baskin
Where is the husband, everyone's asking?
Stimulus check, everybody better cash in
Mask and gloves, yeah, that's a new fashion

[Chorus]
Girl, what did that girl just say?
Girl, ooh—girl
I don't go to work, work
I don't leave, I stay, stay
I don't care I eat, eat, eat, and sleep all day, okay
And then I watch TV, yup
That's just the tea, hunty, yes ma'am
Until they set us free, free
Then I'm gonna let you see
What are you gonna let them see?
My mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
My mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs

[Verse 2]
No school, gym closed
Don't touch these clothes
Need food, this blows
Line at Trader Joe's
At home gym fish
Don't come close, just
Wave, wave, blow a kiss
Mask for mask, sis
Left, right, left, right swiping on Tinder
What was life like? I can't remember
Need my haircut, somebody shave her
Where is all of the toilet paper?

[Chorus]
Girl, what did that girl just say?
Girl, ooh—girl
I don't go to work, work
I don't leave, I stay, stay
I don't care I eat, eat, eat, and sleep all day, okay
And then I watch TV, yup
That's just the tea, hunty, yes ma'am
Until they set us free, free
Then I'm gonna let you see
What are you gonna let them see?
My mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
My mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs
Mask, gloves, soap, scrubs

[Bridge]
Okay, dolls
Y'all know what time it is, come on
Stay inside and lock the door
Stay inside and lock the door
Now I want you to grab that sponge
Grab that broom, get your shout, get your bleach
'Cause I know you want to dance
But it's time to clean that dirt, come on

Mop for me, mop for me, mop
Mop for me, mop for me, mop

Away from me, away from me, away

Sweep for me, sweep for me, sweep

Now sleep for me, sleep for me, sleep

Sleep for me, sleep for me, sleep 
Sleep for me, sleep for me, sleep

Fold clothes for me, clothes for me, clothes
Clothes for me, clothes for me, clothes
Fold clothes for me, clothes for me, clothes
Clothes for me, clothes for me, clothes

Hit the Woah for me, the Woah for me, the Woah

Your knees for me, your knees for me, knees
Hands on your knees for me, your knees for me, your knees
Your knees for me, your knees for me, knees
