[Chorus]
Lice, lice baby, that's right
Kind of impossible to get the
Lice, lice baby

[Verse 1]
Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Yeah, I know that school's out of session
It's tough for your mom and your dad though
Working from home and dealing with the kiddos
Will it ever stop, uh I don't know
Not sure how long this thing is gonna go
But to the extreme, even though we are inside
Maybe it's time to take a look on the bright side
Rolling down a major road
There is no traffic, you can fly to the store
Neighbors on the curbside, waiting just to say hi
Do you have to stop?
I mean, you can just drive by
You can wear sweats, 'cause we don't have bosses
We don't have to go to a teacher conference
And another problem that this fixes
Check out the hair 'cause there's not nits or

[Chorus]
Lice, lice baby
No there's no
Lice, lice baby
It's really hard to get the
Lice, lice baby
Yep, can't get no
Lice, lice baby 

[Verse 2]
Come on, think about it
If you are lice you are bumming
'Cause social distance keeps you from coming
Into my house, 'cause in this instance
You can't jump when we're keeping our distance
Also kids don't have backpacks
It means they don't have no rotten old snacks
Like a banana? 
Yeah, that's gross
Or this green and black piece of toast
Okay, let's move on, wait what is this?
Yo, that's an apple that's turned to a liquid
Okay I get it crew, I get it, it's disgusting
Okay, let's take a break and keep moving on
No car line when school's dismissing
None of our water bottles are missing
And another problem that this fixes
Check out the hair 'cause there's no nits or 

[Chorus]
Lice, lice baby
Yeah, can't get none
Lice, lice baby
Yo, Kim, come on in and tell us how you feel about
Lice, lice baby
Come on represent, come on in, yeah
Lice, lice baby
