[Verse 1]
Where it began
Well, it began in Wuhan
Eating a bat was probably wrong
Seriously, man
COVID-19
It's such a flipping bummer
That's why I wrote this flipping song

[Pre-chorus]
Elbow touching elbow
It's a silly greeting
No, seriously
Infecting me, infecting you

[Chorus]
Sweet Corona
Bad times never seemed so bad
So bad, so bad, so bad
I've been declined
From performing in front of a hundred people or more

[Verse 2]
So I'm sitting at home
Trying to self-quarantine
Loo paper's running kind of low
So I go to Woolworths
Where's all the toilet paper?
Guess I'll be posing with my bow, 
wow I don't know what I sang there

[Pre-chorus]
Elbow touching elbow
Wash you hands
Don't touch your face, touching you

[Chorus]
Sweet Corona
Bad times never seemed so bad
So bad, so bad, so bad
I've been declined
From performing in front of a hundred people or more
It's not like I performed in front of a hundred people anyway
Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no
People don't wanna hear me singing

[Chorus]
Sweet Corona
Bad times never seemed so bad
I've been declined
From performing in front of a hundred people or more
Sweet Corona
Bad times never seemed so bad
I've been declined
From performing in front of a hundred people or more
