[Verse 1]If they take away the footy from Brisbane To Adelaide I’ll have to grumble People will be mad I’ll bet How will the tigers go back to back, with no season that’s pretty hard No doubt their fans will call it theft [Chorus]And what in earth will I do if I can’t yell at referees You know if I can’t vent the to the dog I might be mean I can’t take it out on the umpires standing in their green If there’s no footy because of COVID-19 [Verse 2]I won’t get to see Gawny battle against Nicnat I’ve been hanging for that six months If I can’t be out there cheering for my team when it’s chockers At least let me watch it at the pub [Chorus]I wanna hear the losing coach say that the team is sticking fat But I might not be able because some Chinese ate a bat If the stadium is closed can’t I just watch it on television I don’t know because of COVID-19[Verse 3]If Fyfe Tackles Dangerfield then that could make it spread They want to leave the footy on the shelf Mitchell’s back in the brown and gold How can you cut him off Could the blues surprise, can gold coast get off the floor [Chorus]Think of all the footy fans crying in despair Just when Dyson Heppell finally cuts his hair Got through February and I could smell it coming soon And now we might be waiting until June[Verse 4]I want to see Buddy Franklin make the red and white crowd swellBut will that happen now The bont is so freakish and Toby Greene brings the mongrel Charlie Cameron just wow [Chorus]I want to watch the ups and downs of the blood and sweat and tears Sloane and Gray and Shiel and Membrey racking up the pillAnd I should mention North Melbourne but they aren’t that big a deal Will there be footy with COVID-19 [Interlude]Aaah, aaah[Bridge]Bankers Trust Australia’s gone, gill looks worried, Pendlebury’s not to be seen The season victim of a dusty don’t argue machine [Chrous]I know everyone would love Collingwood in quarantine But there’d be no footy Because of COVID-19 And if the Australian Football League is closed When will it reconvene if there’s no footy Because of COVID-19
