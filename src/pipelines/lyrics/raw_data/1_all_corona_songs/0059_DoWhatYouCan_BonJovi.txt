[Verse 1]
Tonight, they're shutting down the borders
And they boarded up the schools
Small towns are rolling up their sidewalks
One last paycheck coming through
I know you're feeling kind of nervous
We're all a little bit confused
Nothing's the same, this isn't a game
We got to make it through

[Verse 2]
As we wave outside the window
Older loved ones stay inside
Moms and babies blowing kisses
May be saving someone's life
They had to cancel graduation
It isn't fair to Skype the prom
Our kids sit home in isolation
TV news is always on

[Chorus]
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This isn't my prayer, it's just a thought
I'm wanting to send
Around here we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

[Verse 3]
The chicken farm from Arkansas
Bought workers PPE
Not before five hundred more
Had succumbed to this disease
Honest men and honest women
Working for an honest wage
I got a hundred point one fever
And we still got bills to pay

[Chorus]
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This isn't my prayer, it's just a thought
I'm wanting to send
Around here we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

[Verse 4]
They built a hospital on East Meadow
In Central Park last night
Doctors, nurses, truckers
Grocery store clerks manning the front lines
I saw a Red Cross on the Hudson
They turned off the Broadway lights
Another ambulance screams by
There by the grace of God go I

[Verse 5]
Although I'll keep my social distance
What this world needs is a hug
Until we find the vaccination
There's no substitute for love
So love yourself and love your family
Love your neighbor and your friend
Isn't it time we loved the stranger
They're just a friend you haven't met yet

[Chorus]
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This isn't my prayer, it's just a thought
I'm wanting to send
Around here we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

[Outro]
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
