[Chorus]
COVID-19 ,know the facts, know the disease 
If you get sick in 2020 begin the quarantine
COVID-19, don't freak out but don't be a fool 
Misinformation is all I see, please consult the CDC
Always wash your hands for a minimum of 20 seconds 
If you use sanitizer, no less than 60 percent alcohol 

[Verse]
Stay home if you have a fever with a cough 
You are still contagious while you’re asymptomatic 
Six feet of contact is all that it needs 
Respiratory droplets from a sneeze 
Transmission form surfaces commonly touched 
Two days to two weeks until symptoms show up 

[Chorus]
COVID-19 ,know the facts, know the disease 
If you get sick in 2020 begin the quarantine
COVID-19, don't freak out but don't be a fool 
Misinformation is all I see, please consult the CDC

[Solo: guitar]

[Outro]
Disinfect your kitchen, it's where you make your food 
Disinfect your bathroom, it's where you share your poos
Disinfect your door knobs, they'll get you by surprise 
And most importantly don't touch your nose, mouth and eyes
Don't go to china, don't eat the noodles 
Don't go to Japan, don't eat the sushi
Don't go to Italy, don't eat the spaghetti 
Don't go to Iran, you shouldn't be going there anyway
Don't be a racist, be nice to the Asians 
You won’t get the virus from Panda Express
If you're still angry, get mad at the incompetent politicians who won't do their fucking jobs
