[Intro]
Yeah, yeah 

[Verse]
Yeah, been lowkey, but I came back with it
I want thirty kilos a month
I don't never see a rut
They know I stay hella blunt
All my Original Gangsters in the front
I'm about to go flex if I want to
Stoney-Stresow, that's a one-two
You all wish this be all my exes
She got friends that could come too, woah
No plays but they mess with me now
No dates but she rest with my now
No one could really fuck with me, wow
I might go back to the ground
All missed shots look like five star
Make like six figs off my sidebars
My throwaways make more than your albums
Look, we made it so far, ooh
Three-ways just get messy
Told that chick don't text me
You know you just stress me out
You know you just stress me out
I just threw out all my doubt, guess this it
I was burnout, almost quit, yeah
Now we in the mix
And the conversation might of shocked the nation
I've been killing shit, you know it
Every record in twenty eighteen, twenty nineteen I've broken
Dammit, I'm chosen, God really gave me a grind
Momma be crying for me, I promise you I'll be fine, ayy
Until I'm the greatest unsigned
Fuck being greatest alive
You all taking videos in the studio
I'm taking videos in [???]
I know they all down, I never chased so
Dropped out and bought out, talking some pesos
I saw some dark days but we made it through that
They want me to end my life, I can't do that
Real ones staying for the changeup
Fake fans left, we don't want you all
My whole team getting lit now
You think I'm giving up now? No 

No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
