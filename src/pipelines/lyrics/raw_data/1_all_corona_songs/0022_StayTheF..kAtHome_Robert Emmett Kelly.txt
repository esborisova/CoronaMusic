[Verse 1]
The world has caught a virus so I've written you a poem
We need your help to cure it so stay the fuck at home 
And if you have got 12 kids or your living on your own 
Lock it down and isolate and stay the fuck at home 

[Chorus]
If you think youâ€™re not at risk here, you're living in a dome
It spreads faster than a hooker's legs so stay the fuck at home 

[Verse 2]
I need the gym I need the beach, I hear you bitch and moan 
You need to grow a brain cell and stay the fuck at home 
But I feel fine, I do not feel sick, I'll go out on my own 
How thick are you, you selfish prick, please just stay the fuck at home

[Verse 3]
From LA through to Berlin, from Wuhan though to Rome, there's people dying everyday so stay the fuck at home 
If you need to contact family use Facebook, Skype, or Phone
We have got the fucking internet so stay the fuck at home 

[Chorus]
The only way to slow it down is isolate not roam
Please help the world get back on track and stay the fuck at home 
Stay the fuck at home, stay the fuck at home 
Don't you be a fucking dick please stay the fuck at home
