[Intro]
Ha ha COVID-on- nine productions 

[Verse 1]
I have not touched my face in 33 long days it's been so hard
I wash my hands like a dirty man every chance I can 
Now it's gone too far
Difficulty breathing, can't stop sneezing with a nasty cough 
Everybody lurking, looking like surgeons, and it's all your fault 

[Chorus]
Hey corona we, we don't want you around we are so sick, we are so sick of you
Hey corona we, we don't want you around we are so sick, we are so sick of you
Let's go back to the flu like in the old days 
Because ain't nobody got time for a new plague, we're so sick of you

[Verse 2]
Time to quarantine ourselves take baths in listerine or else everybody wash your hands 
Shake them off, do it again
I told the devil not today I do not want to die this way 
Allow me to sanitise everything in my whole life

[Chorus]
Hey corona we, we don't want you around we're so sick, we're so sick of you
Hey corona we, we don't want you around we're so sick, we're so sick of you
Let's go back to the flu like in the old days 
Because ain't nobody got time for a new plague, we're so sick of you
We're so sick, we're so sick 
We're so sick, we're so sick of you
