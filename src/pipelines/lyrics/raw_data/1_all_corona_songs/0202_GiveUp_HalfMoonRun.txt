[Count Off]
Un, deux, trois, quatre

[Verse 1]
I just wanted
To resolve it
To make peace with
All my dearest, yeah

[Chorus]
But we all just give up
Yeah, we all stand down
With no lesson learned
With our eyes half shut

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
No confusion, no
It's been obvious how
Hallelujah!
I've been saved by no one again, and again

[Chorus]
But we all just give up
Yeah, we all stand down
With no lesson learned
With our eyes half shut
