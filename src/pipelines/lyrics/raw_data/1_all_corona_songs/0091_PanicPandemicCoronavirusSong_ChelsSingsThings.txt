[Verse 1]
There's this sort of mania 
That's sweeping Australia 
An outbreak, if you will
And it's highly contagious 
You can even say dangerous 
And you can't stop it with a pill
There's no known cure
And you're not safe in public
You're not safe in your home 
You can catch it just by looking at your TV or your phone 
Look out for early symptoms, such as avoiding your Chinese neighbor 
Or a sudden uncontrollable urge to start hoarding toilet paper

[Chorus]
It's the panic pandemic 
Emotional contagion 
The panic pandemic 
Spreading misinformation 
The panic pandemic 
But you still stand a change 
Against the panic pandemic
Just chill out and wash your hands
