[Chorus]
All of my mind is in corona, ooh na na
It came all the way from China, na na na
Everyone's freaking out, corona 
There's something about this virus
Corona, ooh na na

[Verse 1]
We've got obsessed with sanitizers
Although it's scarce now
Masks have become the fashion statement
Preventive measures
If anyone sneezes, we lose our mind
Get the hell out of there
Maintain distance from foreigners

[Pre-chorus]
I'm feeling like ooh
We also might get it
If we are not hygienic
I'm feeling like ooh
We want to feel safe
But we're not getting
Work from home, na na na

[Chorus]
Corona, ooh na na
All of my mind is in corona, ooh na na
It came all the way from China, na na na
Everyone's freaking out, corona 
There's something about this virus
Corona, ooh na na
