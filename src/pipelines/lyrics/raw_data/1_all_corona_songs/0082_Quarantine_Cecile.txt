You Deh pon me mind

[Verse 1]
Can’t believe this shit

The amount a picture me a look upon

Look how much time me waste when me could have ride upon it 
Me never know there would have been a day when me would have wish for and have to reminisce on it

Clothes off, start sweat
You know you have it like cobra flex
Mash up the place like a Jamfever set
Apologies to you

Sorry for all the times when you beg and me no give you 
You Beg and me no give you 
Now me well want give you
