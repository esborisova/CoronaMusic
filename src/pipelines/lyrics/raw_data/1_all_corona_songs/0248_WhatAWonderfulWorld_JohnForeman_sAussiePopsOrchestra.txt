[Verse 1]I see trees so green, red roses tooI see them bloom for me and you.And I think to myself what a wonderful world.[Verse 2]I see skies so blue and clouds so white.The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night.And I think to myself what a wonderful world.[Chorus]The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the skyAlso on the faces of people going by.I see friends not shaking hands saying how do you do.They're really saying I love you.[Verse 3]I see babies crying, I watch them grow.They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.And I think to myself what a wonderful world.[Chorus]The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the skyAlso on the faces of people going by.I see friends not shaking hands saying how do you do.I know they’re saying I love you.[Verse 4]I see babies crying, I watch them grow.They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.And I think to myself what a wonderful world.[outro](Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world)
