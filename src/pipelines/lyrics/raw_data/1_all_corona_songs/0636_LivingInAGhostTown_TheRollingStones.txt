[Chorus]
I'm a ghost
Living in a ghost town
I'm a ghost
Living in a ghost town
 
[Verse 1]
You can look for me
But I can’t be found
You can search for me
I had to go underground
Life was so beautiful
Then we all got locked down
Feel like a ghost 
Living in a ghost town

[Pre-chorus] 
Once this place was humming
And the air was full of drumming
The sounds of cymbals crashing 
Glasses were all smashing
Trumpets were all screaming
Saxophones were blaring
Nobody was caring
If it's day or night

[Chorus] 
I'm a ghost 
Living in a ghost town
I'm going nowhere 
Shut up all alone 
So much time to lose
Just staring at my phone
 
[Bridge]
Every night I am dreaming
That you'll come and creep in my bed
Please let this be over 
Not stuck in a world without end

[Solo: Guitar]

[Chorus]
I’m a ghost 
Living in a ghost town
You can look for me 
But I can’t be found

[Outro]
We’re all living in a ghost town
Living in a ghost town
We were so beautiful
I was your man about town 
Living in this ghost town
It isn’t any fun 
If I want a party 
It’s a party of one
