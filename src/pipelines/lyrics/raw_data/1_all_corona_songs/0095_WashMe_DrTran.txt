[Introduction]
Are you not going to wash your hands? 
Clean hands though, germs are gross, tell us all, but I just did it

[Pre-Chorus]
Now watch me rinse my germs away 
Now watch me rinse, rinse my germs away
Now watch me rinse my germs away
Now watch me rinse, rinse my germs away

[Chorus]
Oh wash me, wash me
Oh wash me, wash me
Oh wash these, wash these
Oh ok oh ok 
Oh wash me, wash me
Oh wash me, wash me
Oh wash these, wash these
oh oh oh 

[Verse]
Wash these bugs away, wash those germs away, wash that grease away, wash that dirt away, was those bugs away, wash those germs away, wash that grease away, wash that dirt away
Sanitize, sanitize, oh save some lives, save some lives
So do not pout, so do not pout, washing it out, in and out
I wash them everyone from mom and pops, I wash them nurses, staff and all them got 
I wash them from the wards to carry out 
Now watch me in the cafe or even give shoppers, watch me rinse my germs away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now watch me rinse rinse my germs away 
Now watch me rinse my germs away 
Now watch me rinse, rinse my germs away I am not touching anything 
Oh wash me wash me, oh wash me wash me, oh wash these wash these, oh ok oh ok 
Oh wash me wash me, oh wash me wash me, oh wash these wash these oh oh oh 

[Bridge]
Not even you can clean that superman, time number 2 maybe you did not wash your hands
Not even you can clean that superman, time number 2 maybe you did not wash your hands
Now watch me scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub-a-dub, dub 
Now use that soap and warm water, gel or spray
Easy alcohol gonna wash me a big one from my hand pumps 
Now watch me nurses, staff and all things 
Now watch me from the wards to every op
Now watch me even if you are rocking cool socks

[Pre-Chorus]You can rinse your germs away, now you can rinse, you are not too busy
You can rinse your germs away, now you can rinse, you are not too busy

[Chorus]
Oh wash me, wash me
Oh wash me, wash me
Oh wash these, wash these
Oh ok oh ok 
Oh wash me, wash me
Oh wash me, wash me
Oh wash these, wash these
oh oh oh 
Cleaned it, cleaned it
