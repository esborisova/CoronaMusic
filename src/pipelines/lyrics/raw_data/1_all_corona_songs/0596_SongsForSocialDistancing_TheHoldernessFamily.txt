[Verse 1]
We're at home together
As the numbers rise 
And everyone's tired
Of staying inside, yeah
Maybe was a bad call
To play football games, yeah
Oh, we did it once, will we do it again?

[Chorus]
It's another lockdown
Get it babe, you've got it
Another lockdown
It's hard to do both at the same time

[Verse 2]
Two three four
Back from the store
Every year she buys some more
Big bows, big bows, big bows, big bows
From the windows to the walls
One thousand of these balls
Decorate these halls
Ah, wreath wreath from your mother
Hang that wreath over there
Garland leaf for your mother
Hang that leaf from the stairs

[Spoken word]
Sorry, it's not Covid, I'm good, just sneezed a little
Okay, here we go

[Verse 3]
Here comes Amazon, here comes Amazon
Right down Amazon lane
They are on our street so much
It should be our street name
Doorbell ringing
Man is bringing boxes to my wife
Our checkbook balance is getting low
'Cause Amazon comes tonight
Alright

[Verse 4]
Pass me the cheese
I'm putting on some LB's
I got buttered popcorn
Stuck here in my molar
The Who, baby
My pants are now the wrong size
'Cause I don't exercise
2020 getting worse
Now that it's getting colder

[Spoken word]
So there's really only one solution
The really no reason you should ever put on a belt or wear any pants 
You should always be on this, right honey
You live by this

[Chorus]
That's an elastic waistband
My pants have an elastic waistband
It's an elastic waistband
Only wear elastic waistband
