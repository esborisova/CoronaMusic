[Verse 1]
Somewhere in China, a bat took a leak
Pissed all over some uncooked meat
Some dude bought it, scarfed it down
Got real sick, and he passed it around
Long story short, now my grandma is in the ground

[Chorus]
Now I’m stuck at home all alone
Keeping both hands clean
I hope I don’t die from the COVID-19

[Verse 2]
Wanna get to the bank and unload my cash
Not for spending but for wiping my ass
Should have stocked up on water and bread
I’m hungry as hell and Kenny Rogers is dead
It wasn’t from the COVID, at least that’s what they said
Don’t believe it

[Chorus]
Now I’m stuck at home all alone
Keeping both hands clean
I hope I don’t die from the COVID-19

[Bridge]
Tom Hanks was a hell of a guy
Rand Paul, now I’m starting to cry
Idris Elba, I don’t know who he is, I’m not gonna lie

[Chorus]
Now I’m stuck at home all alone
Keeping both hands clean
I hope I don’t die from the COVID-19
I hope I don’t die from the COVID-19
