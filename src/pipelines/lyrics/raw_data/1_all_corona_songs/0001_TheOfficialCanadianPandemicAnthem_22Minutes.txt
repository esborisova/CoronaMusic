[Verse 1]
Wear pants if you want to
Or leave your pants behind 
Because I like to wear pants 
But when I wear pants 
They will be the stretchy kind

[Verse 2]
We can't go where we want to
It's not safe to go outside
But that's ok, don't want to anyway
Want to sit on my behind 
In stretchy pants

[Verse 3]
I just want to scrub
A scrub is the way I can get my hands so clean
Scrub until they are cracked and dry
Then hand sanitize to keep away covid nineteen 

[Verse 4]
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But what's your number? For contact tracing 
And if we lock down, into Phase 3
I'll need your number, for contact tracing

[Verse 5]
It's in my head
In my head
Swab me
Swab me
Swab me, oh, oh

[Verse 6]
I get locked down, but open up again
You're never going to keep me home
I get locked down, but open up again
We will never keep the numbers down

[Verse 7]
COVID nineteen, oh I need that vaccine
At this moment, I'd pay anything

[Verse 8]
For a dose of the Pfizer, it's a needle of life
But we don't know the date of its arrival
It's a change for survival but no shipment's in sight
Still we won't give up hope for a dose
Of the Pfizer

[Verse 9]
Why did I have to go and be the first one vaccinated?
I'm thinking that if 
I'm the only one that has, I probably should've waited
I had plans to
Hit the mall
A pub crawl
Grab a steak
On a date 
But I guess you're all quarantined still
Probably I'm solitary until everybody takes it
No, no, no

[Verse 10]
Five hundred, twenty-five thousand, six hundred zoom calls
Five hundred, twenty-five thousand, six hundred variants to fear
That's twenty-eight seasons now for twenty-two minutes
And that's the way we saw the world this year
