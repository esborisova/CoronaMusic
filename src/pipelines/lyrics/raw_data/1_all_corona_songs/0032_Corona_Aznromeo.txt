[Chorus]
Corona, oh-na-na
I got a virus from China, oh-na-na
It make me crazy yelling 
Du-ma-du-mama
I think I got it from your mother
When I touch her vagina 
Oh-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
I cough one time and they send me back here
What is this bullshit?
I'm Vietnamese, I'm not duh Chinese
Don't know the difference
How I get sick, I live in a tree?
How can I live without bubble tea?
Jackie Chan went achoo 
And so they went and got him
And flew him back to Wuhan
Now there's no rush hour four
I plastic bottle on head 
But it still not work

[Chorus]
Oh-du-ma-ma-ma-ma
Corona-oh-na-na
I got a virus from China oh na na
It make me crazy yelling 
Du-ma-du-ma-ma
I think I got it from your mother
When I touch her vagina 
Oh-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
Now real talk
This is what I mean
What you wanna do fam?
What you wanna see?
I cough one time, and they think I got the virus 
Bitch, you know that's fucking, racist!
I don't eat dog, I eat the cat dish
I don't drive badly, I just don't give shit
I make napalm that would blow your lỗ đít 
I'm no Asian you want to fuck with
No, ma

[Verse 3]
Everyday pray to Korean Jesus 
Make me pass my exams with aces
And make my pee-pee grow some inches
And don't put corona in my anus 
Line at the airport 
Line at the movies
Confucius say, do not worry
Yell "ching chong" and pretend to sneeze
And now you see, the line empty

[Chorus]
Oh-du-ma-ma-ma-ma
Corona-oh-na-na
I got a virus from China oh na na
It make me crazy yelling 
Du-ma-du-ma-ma
I think I got it from your mother
When I touch her vagina 
Oh-na-na-na-na-na
