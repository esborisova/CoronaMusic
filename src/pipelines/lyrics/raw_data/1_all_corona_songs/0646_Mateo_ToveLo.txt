[Verse 1]
Never stood out in the crowd the way you do
Wish I could have some more time alone with you
But the line is getting longer by the minute, by the minute
And it's filled with pretty girls
With pretty girls that never been rejected, no
Yeah, it's filled with pretty girls
That never heard the words "I'm not interested"

[Chorus]
I act so cool but that's not me
Still not the one you choose to see
I don't ever wanna let you go, no
Mateo, Mateo, Mateo, my love
You always look for something new
I hope I get my turn with you
I don't ever wanna let you go, no
Mateo, Mateo, Mateo, my love

[Verse 2]
Never see you on your own, but you're alone
Don't know why the need to fix you turns me on
Think whoever took your heart is gone forever, is gone forever
And now all the pretty girls, now all the pretty girls
They wanna love you, yeah
Hurting all the pretty girls
That never heard the words, "It's not about you"

[Chorus]
I act so cool but that's not me
Still not the one you choose to see
I don't ever wanna let you go, no
Mateo, Mateo, Mateo, my love
You always look for something new
I hope I get my turn with you
I don't ever wanna let you go, no
Mateo, Mateo, Mateo, my love

[Verse 3]
What, what 'bout my pride?
Never been chasin' but I'm chasin' now, no
Love, love makes you wild
Know you will beat the best I ever had, no
What, what 'bout my pride?
Never been chasin' but I'm chasin' now, no
Love, love's gonna hurt
Yeah, I promise the world's gonna burn if you choose her

[Chorus]
I act so cool but that's not me
Still not the one you choose to see
I don't ever wanna let you go, no
Mateo, Mateo, Mateo, my love
You always look for something new
I hope I get my turn with you
I don't ever wanna let you go, no
Mateo, Mateo, Mateo, my love
