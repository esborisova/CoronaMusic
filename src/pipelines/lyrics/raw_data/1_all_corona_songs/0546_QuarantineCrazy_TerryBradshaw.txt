[Verse 1]
I told my wife to be patient with me
I'll slow it down and find some time, you'll see
To spend with you and these bundles of joy
Well, my wish came true but it wasn't by choice

[Verse 2]
Now all this time with them has sure been a blessing
Just hanging out together 24/7
No, it was fun for a week, I'll admit it
But my cabin fever's about to reach its limit

[Chorus]
Oh quarantine crazy
I'm talking straight-jacket lately
Another day or two might break me
I'm going quarantine crazy

[Verse 3]
I'm achy breaky like Billy Ray Cyrus
'Cause if I leave I might get that virus
We're all out of beans and all out of taters
Come in unravel like the last toilet paper 

[Chorus]
Going quarantine crazy
I'm talking straight-jacket lately
Another day or two might break me
I'm going quarantine crazy

[Solo: Guitar]

[Bridge]
I've seen every episode of Dora the Explorer
The kids are all fighting while the dogs all are snoring
If I ever say I need some time off again
Somebody punch me square in the chin

[Chorus]
I'm going quarantine crazy
[Inaudible] out of my mind lately
Don't usually let nothing face me
I'm going quarantine crazy
I'm pretty sure my wife hates me
I'm going quarantine crazy
Oh I'm losing my mind
I am not happy
