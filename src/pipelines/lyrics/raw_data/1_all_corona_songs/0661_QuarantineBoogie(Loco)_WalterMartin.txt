[Verse 1]
I was feeling weird
I had a half-assed beard 
As I’d just about cleared a month of quarantine
Been locked inside
With my kids and my bride
And a shrinking supply of dried kidney beans   
Two kids I’m home teaching
In a home I've been bleaching
In a marriage that’s screeching to a grinding halt
My savings got erased
I can’t touch my face
And the only place I feel safe is in a webinar

[Chorus]
Yeah, I’ve gone a bit loco, loco
Spent the morning cloroxing my last can of Budweiser
Yeah, I’ve gone a bit loco, loco
Spent the afternoon sanitizing my hand sanitizer

[Verse 2]
Sure, I've tried meditation 
But it led to frustration
And vivid visualizations of the end of days
So I tried learning karate
Signed up for online pilates
But when your life’s in the potty, it’s hard to concentrate
So now I’m sitting here
Scratching on my beard
But all this existential fear has set my stomach off
And the main side effect
Of all this time to reflect 
Is we’ve gone through every last speck of Charmin extra soft

[Chorus]
And I’ve gone a bit loco, loco
I clicked on the wrong house party link and started some family drama
Yeah I’ve gone a bit loco, loco
Just watched some guy from Death Cab for Cutie do a concert in his pajamas

[Solo: Clarinet]

[Bridge]
But the birds still sing
And the bees still sting
And I still refuse to watch Tiger King

[Chorus]
But I’ve gone a bit loco
Loco, loco, loco, loco, loco
I’ve gone a bit loco
Loco, loco, loco, loco, loco, loco
Yeah I’ve gone a bit loco
Loco, loco, loco, loco, loco, loco
