[Verse 1]
As I walk this wicked world
Searching for light in the darkness of insanity, oh yeah
I ask myself, is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred and misery?
And each time I feel like this inside
There's one thing I want to know

[Chorus]
What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny about peace, love and understanding?

[Verse 2]
And as I walked on through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong? And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony? Sweet harmony
Because each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me want to cry

[Chorus]
What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?
What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny about peace, love and understanding?
