[Verse 1]One day more Another day, another destiny This never-ending road of quarantine These people have coronavirus, leaders trying to inspire us one day more[Verse 2]I did not leave the house today I will not leave the house tomorrow One day moreI will not leave my house till May Do you have toilet paper I could borrow? [Verse 2]One more day, all on my phone Will we ever meet again?One more day of posts and sharing I was bored todayWhere are you What a life I might have known And I swear I miss you, too But I cannot go out there [Verse 3]One more day before the swarm Do I follow where they go When we all will gain our freedom Shall I join my brothers thereWhen the weather starts to warm Do I stay or do I dare?Will you take your place with me?We’re not allowed What day, unclear [Verse 4]One day more One more day of isolation, we will nip it in the bud We will flatten out the curve, now We will help to stem the flood One day moreWiping down the bags, wiping down the cart Suiting up to venture to the grocery mart Here a little mas, there a little glove Please, sir, keep your distance, I don’t want to shove One more day of so much winning I can smell the freedom night It will all be gone by spring Will it all be gone by spring The economy is spinning There’s a bailout to be done Did you see the market swing?I’ll stay right here We will get through [Verse 5]One day more I will call these people heroes Will follow their advice I will learn from their experience Nurses, doctors, our white knights One day more [Part with all voices at once][Outro]Tomorrow is another dayTomorrow feels like worlds away Tomorrow we’ll discover how much longer Cuomo shuts the store One more gone One more case One day more
