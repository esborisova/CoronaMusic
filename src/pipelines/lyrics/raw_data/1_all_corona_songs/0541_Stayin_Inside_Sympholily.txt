[Verse 1]
I look out to where I used to walk
Not a soul in sight, no one to talk
Is it hot in here? I'm getting warm
Doing exercise on my front lawn

[Pre-chorus]
But now it's alright, that's okay
Just turn and walk the other way
We can try to understand
The virus' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're staying inside, staying inside
Feel the city breaking 
And everybody shaking
We're staying inside, staying inside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying inside, staying inside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying inside

[Verse 2]
Wash your hands
Now I'm down to my last toilet roll
Why did panic buyers hoard it all?
Haven't changed my shirt for 14 days
Eating raisin toast with mayonnaise

[Pre-chorus]
But now it's alright, that's okay
We'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The virus' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're staying inside, staying inside
Feel the city breaking 
And everybody shaking
We're staying inside, staying inside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying inside, staying inside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying inside

[Bridge]
Wash your hands
I'm going nowhere
Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
I'm going nowhere
Somebody help me
We're staying inside

[Verse 3]
If you're young and fit you might be fine
But the old and vulnerable will die
Spreading COVID-19 around outside
No one wants to be that guy

[Pre-chorus]
But now it's alright, that's okay
Don't go out, just stay away
We can try to understand
The virus' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're staying inside, staying inside
Feel the city breaking 
And everybody shaking
We're staying inside, staying inside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying inside, staying inside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying inside
Stay inside
