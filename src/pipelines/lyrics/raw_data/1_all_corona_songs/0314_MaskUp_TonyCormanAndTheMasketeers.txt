Mask it, mask it on up (gotta mask it)
Mask it, mask it on up
Mask it, mask it on up
Come on mask it, mask it on up

[Hook]
Mask it on up 
If you’re going downtown 
Mask it on up
If there’s people around 
Mask it on up 
It’ the right thing to do 
You wear a mask for me I wear a mask for you 

[Verse 1]
Have you had enough (yes I have) of that COVID stuff (COVID-19)
You may think your tough (your tough) 
Showing off (showing off)
But nature bats last (bats last) so be sure to mask it 
Nobody wants you coming home in a basket (in a basket) 

[Hook]
Mask it on up (you gotta wear a mask, yeah)
You gotte wear the mask 
Mask it on up, it ain’t too much to ask (it ain’t too much to ask)
Mask it on up, if there’s people around (there’s so many people around)
Mask it on up, if you’re wearing a surgical gown 

[Verse 2]
You can get them from Gucci 
You can buy them on Etsy 
You can us a bandana 
From your old aunt Betsy
You can take some old pajamas (pajamas)
And make them for yourself
If you’re lucky (you’re lucky), you can find them on a pharmacy shelf  
Now, break it on down

[Verse 3]
When you’re wearing a mask 
Be sure you’re wearing it right
Cover your nose, cover your mouth 
And let’s make sure to tie it tight 
It won’t work right if you’re wearing it wrong 
So keep the short side short 
And long side long 

[Hook]
Mask it on up, if you’re going downtown (going downtown)
Mask it on up, if there’s people around (So many people around)
Mask it on up, it’s the right thing to do (the right thing to do)
You wear a mask for me, I wear a mask for you (come on I wear a mask for you)
