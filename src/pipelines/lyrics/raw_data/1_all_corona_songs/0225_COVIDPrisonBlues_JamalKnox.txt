[Verse 1]
Well, I hear big corona coming
It's rolling around the bend 
And I ain't seen the outside 
Since I don't know when 
I'm stuck in COVID prison 
And time keeps dragging on 
But old corona keeps rolling
While I’m stuck at home 

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby 
My Mama told me, son always be a good boy 
Don't cough on folks for fun 
But I smacked a man in Walmart 
Cause he got too close 
When I hear my neighbor coughing
I know that there’s no hope 

[Solo: Guitar]

[Verse 3]
Well, I bet those dumb folks eating 
In a fancy dining bar 
They're probably drinking coffee
And smoking big cigars 
They don’t know big corona is coming
I know I can't be free 
But those people keep on moving 
And that's what tortures me 

[Solo: Guitar]

[Verse 4]
Well, if they freed me from this prison 
If the doctor said it’s fine 
I bet I'd move it on a little 
Farther down the line 
Far from COVID Prison 
That's where I want to stay 
Then I'd let that girl from Tinder 
Blow my blues away
