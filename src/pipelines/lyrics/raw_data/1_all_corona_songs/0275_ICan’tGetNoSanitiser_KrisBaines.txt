[Chorus]I can’t get no sanitizer I can’t get no sanitizer But I tried, and I tried, and I tried, then I cried I can’t get noI can’t get no[Verse 1]When I’m driving in my car No matter where I go, or how far There’s just no more left on the shelves So how can we expect to clean ourselves We can’t get no sanitizer ‘Cause it’s all gone Hey, hey, hey That’s what I say Hey, hey, hey
