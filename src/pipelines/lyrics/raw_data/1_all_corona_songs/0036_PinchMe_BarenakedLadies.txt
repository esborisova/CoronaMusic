[Verse 1]
It's the perfect time of year
Somewhere far away from here
I feel fine enough, I guess
Considering everything's a mess
There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk, but I'll just drive
Not supposed to go outside

[Chorus]
It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone then you
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when you
Try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time because the way I rhyme is going to make you smile when you
Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
Try to figure out what all this is for

[Verse 2]
It's the perfect time of day
To throw all your cares away
Put the sprinkler on the lawn
And run through with no clothing on
Take a drink right from the stove
And change into some warmer clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Sleep away the afternoon

[Chorus]
It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone then you
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when you
Try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time because the way I rhyme is going to make you smile when you
Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
Try to figure out what all this is for

[Bridge]
Pinch me
Pinch me
Because I'm still
Asleep
Please, God
Tell me
That I'm still asleep

[Verse 3]
On an evening such as this 
It's hard to tell if I exist
If I packed a car and leave this town
Who'll notice that I'm not around?
I could hide out under there
I just made you say "underwear"
I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway

[Chorus]
It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone then you
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when you
Try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time because the way I rhyme is going to make you smile when you
Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
Try to figure out what all this is for

[Outro]
Pinch me
Trying to figure out what all this is for
Pinch me
Trying to see the world beyond your front door
Pinch me
Trying to figure out what all this is for

[Spoken]
One, two, three, four
