[Verse 1]
When I grew up my family was very very poor
But we scrapped by and somehow we kept hunger from the door
Even in the meanest times y daddy used to say
No matter what you'll always get your three squares a day
Daddy might have been in debt
He earned his wages with his sweat
But we knew we would always get three squares a day

[Verse 2]
But to this end we soon did learn we had to do our part
Saving money cutting corners we had to live smart 
So with toilet paper to his rule we would obey
With no excuse we'd only use three squares a day
And he said do your part for Uncle Sammy 
Learn a bit of origami 
You can score a triple whammy 
Three squares a day

[Verse 3]
Three squares a day
My daddy used to say
Are your allotted rations come what may
Three squares a day
Keeps bankruptcy at bay
But today there is an issue
That you can't buy toilet tissue
Oh how I miss you my three squares a day
