[Spoken Words]I’m going insane, I’m going crazy[Verse 1]We live in fear and every time we see a neighbor A fear oh, don't you come nearGotta limit on friendship Tell me how will I get through without my entire crew Stuck in my apartment my roommate just farted Could this get worse or are we just cursed Can’t watch the news ‘cause it freaks me out But reminds me what this is all about [Chorus]We’re a team, we’re a team, we’re a team We can beat this thingQuarantine, quarantineAnd we may lose our minds But we’ll stay alive [Verse 2]My love language is physical touch and I never knew I could miss it this much Now I’m all alone without a paycheck was already broke (I am a wreck)It’s been days and I haven’t bathed but my bed is sinking from my weight When I walk around looks like a ghost town like I’ve never seen and I wanna scream [Chorus]We’re a team, we’re a team, we’re a team We can beat this thingQuarantine, quarantineAnd we may lose our minds But we’ll stay alive[Verse 3]It feels like years but fighting through my tears Stuck in one place I’m going to, I’m going to need space It all feels wrong I can’t even hug my mom So I sing this song Now that we see how determent we can be to save people in need This goes to show when you’re feeling lone You can be a hero, hero, hero[Chorus]We’re a team, we’re a team, we’re a team We can beat this thingQuarantine, quarantineAnd we may lose our minds But we’ll stay alive[Bridge][Spoken words]How many days has it been?I don’t know, probably like four I’m so alone We will get through this togetherJust know that it won’t be forever The future is bright just make sure your friends are alright [Chorus]We’re a teamWe can beat this thingAnd we may lose our minds But we’ll stay alive[Chorus]We’re a team, we’re a team, we’re a team We can beat this thingQuarantine, quarantineAnd we may lose our minds But we’ll stay alive[Chorus]We’re a team, we’re a team, we’re a team We can beat this thingQuarantine, quarantineAnd we may lose our minds But we’ll stay aliveThrough the quarantine
