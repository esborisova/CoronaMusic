[Verse 1]
The moon is full but there is an incompleteness
The days are beautiful but I feel a bitter sweetness
If I had a wish, or even a choice
I'd wake up to the sound of your voice
How I miss waking up to the sound of your voice

[Verse 2] 
I let you down and fell off of your good list
I hope each day you'll find peace and forgiveness
The alarm clock rings, what a lonely noise
And I long for the sound of your voice
Yeah, how I miss waking up to the sound of your voice

[Bridge] 
Take it from me: there's not much to see in this void
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 3] 
The saying goes there will be other dances (don't give up)
This little song is about second chances so
Say the word and I will rejoice
And wake up to the sound of your voice
Oh, how I miss waking up to the sound
To the sound
To the sound, to the sound
To the sound, to the sound
Waking up to the sound of your voice

[Bridge] 
Take it from me: there's not much to see in this void
