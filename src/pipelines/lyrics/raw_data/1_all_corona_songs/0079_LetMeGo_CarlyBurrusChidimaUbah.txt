[Verse 1]
The tablet glows bright on the table tonight, not a teacher to be seen
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm here for weeks 
My kids are crying and all our brains are fried
I can't teach these kids heaven knows I've tried 

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't get to me covid nineteen 
I'll be the perfect mom that Facebook sees
This third grade math, will steal my soul
In this hell hole

[Chorus]
Let me go
Let me go
Can't stay inside anymore 
Let me go
Let me go
I can't do fractions anymore 
I don't care, what your lessons say
Turn the TV on
Mama's got to cry so look away

[Spoken]
All you parents that this relates to, you can go cry right now 
Go you deserve it 
Because you're in quarantine so no one can see you
No one can see you
SO sing along with us 

[Chorus]
Let me go
Let me go
Can't stay inside anymore 
Let me go
Let me go
I can't do fractions anymore 
I don't care, what your lessons say
Turn the TV on
Mama's got to cry so walk away
