[Verse 1]
Tonight, they're shutting down the borders
And they boarded up the schools
Small towns are rolling up their sidewalks
One last paycheck coming through
I know you're feeling kind of nervous
We're all a little bit confused
Nothing's the same, this isn't a game
We got to make it through

[Chorus]
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This isn't my prayer, it's just a thought
I'm wanting to send
Around here we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus]
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This isn't my prayer, it's just a thought
I'm wanting to send
Around here we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

[Outro]
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
