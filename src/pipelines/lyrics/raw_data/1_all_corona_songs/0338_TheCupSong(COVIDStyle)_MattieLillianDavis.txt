[Verse 1]I got my key to stay locked in my house To bottles of whiskey for each dayAnd I sure would like some sweet company But you have to stay six feet away [Chorus]This virus sucks This virus sucks Yeah, this pandemic really sucks I miss human interaction Remind how the hell this happened Coronavirus really sucks [Verse 2]All of my jobs are shutting down My cat is glad to have me home But I miss seeing all my friends Only so much Netflix I can binge Oh, this actually could be the end [Chorus]HahaThis virus sucks Covid you sucksThe Chinese virus called by Trump Big old yikes We will miss you say goodbye yesterday I almost got big hair die And now IÕm here banging on a cup [Chorus]This virus blows It really blows IÕd leave my house, but where would go I tried painting, I tried yogaOne more puzzle and I throw up So IÕll be here singing all alone Cheers
