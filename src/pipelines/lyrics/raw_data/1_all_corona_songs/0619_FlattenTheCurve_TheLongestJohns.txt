[Verse 1]
Come all you bold heroes
Give an ear to my song
For we're self-isolating
And the days feel so long
But it's still probably worth it
Our health to preserve

[Chorus]
So let's stay indoors 
And we'll flatten the curve
We'll flatten the curve
We'll flatten the curve
So let's stay indoors
And we'll flatten the curve

[Verse 2]
The Italians they shut borders
And the Irish shut pubs
From China to the States
Hands are feverishly scrubbed
The French they take dinner
With homemade hors d'oeuvres

[Chorus]
So let's stay indoors 
And we'll flatten the curve
We'll flatten the curve
We'll flatten the curve
So let's stay indoors
And we'll flatten the curve

[Verse 3]
My friends they do attend me
When I'm laid at my ease
Through Facebook and Twitter
They're eager to please
To keep my hopes high
And my mood to observe 

[Chorus]
So let's stay indoors 
And we'll flatten the curve
We'll flatten the curve
We'll flatten the curve
So let's stay indoors
And we'll flatten the curve

[Verse 4]
Grandparents and asthmatics
Well, they need care the best
So let's free up space 
For our dear NHS
We're all in this together
Let our courage not swerve
So proud

[Chorus]
So let's stay indoors 
And we'll flatten the curve
We'll flatten the curve
We'll flatten the curve
So let's stay indoors
And we'll flatten the curve
So let's stay indoors 
And we'll flatten the curve
