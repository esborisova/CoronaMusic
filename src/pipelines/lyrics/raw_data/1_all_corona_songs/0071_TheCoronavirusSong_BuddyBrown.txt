[Verse]
Well I am not trying to scare you and it is not fake news
There is a really good chance that we are all pretty screwed
Because communist china kicked us right in the teeth with a virus from hell and no work for 6 weeks 

[Chorus]
We are all locked down baby and we are trying to get out going bat crazy because we cannot leave the house
I have a fridge full of beer and yay baby is drinking that wine 
I have been washing my hands about 24 times 
It gets worse everyday when I turn on the news, I am thinking God that I cancelled that cruise
I am stuck here singing those ding dong lockdown blues.

[Verse]
Well it all seemed harmless for a couple of days and it all got real when it got Tom Hanks
Now we cannot shake hands and we cannot even sneeze because everyone will freak out and put us in quarantine

[Chorus]
We are all locked down baby and we are trying to get out going bat crazy because we cannot leave the house
I have a fridge full of beer and yay baby is drinking that wine 
I have been washing my hands about 24 times 
It gets worse everyday when I turn on the news, I am thinking God that I cancelled that cruise
I am stuck here singing those ding dong lockdown blues.

[Ending]
It gets worse everyday when I turn on my TV and I am thinking thank God I stocked up on TP
I am stuck here singing those ding dong lockdown blues 
Lockdown blues
