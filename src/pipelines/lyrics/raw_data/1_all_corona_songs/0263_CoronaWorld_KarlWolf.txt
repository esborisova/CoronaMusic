[Verse 1]I can’t show you the worldCause I’m just self-isolating COVID-19 ‘s invaded And I can’t hand sanitize My Uber Eats just arrived I don’t know whether they touch it I’m coughing thinking I have it But Trump tells me we’re alright [Chorus]Corona World A new fucked up reality Can’t even play ping pong Or performe my songs Cause everything’s a shit show Corona worldWhere toilet paper’s not its worth Can’t watch the Raptors play So I watch RuPall’s Drag RaceAnd I’m stuck making videos here for you [Bridge]I’m washing my hands all day A thousand times if I have to Remember going with friends to the movies And play in the arcades[Chorus]Corona World No bottle service or bottle girls I miss drinking gin with friends And shaking hands Now Wilson’s my best friend Corona WorldIn touch with my anxiety Tell me when this will end This long weekend It’s just that I’m so fucking bored with me [Outro]Corona World That’s where I’ll be Can’t catch a case In the same place Just me and me (Coughing)
