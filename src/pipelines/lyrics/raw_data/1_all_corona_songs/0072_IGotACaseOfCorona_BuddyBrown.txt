[Verse 1]
You know my fishing boat is worth a lot of bread 
My brother's UTV is about to hit Craigslist
Heard it's worth twelve five but he might take eight
If I'm going down I'm getting drunk dang straight

[Chorus]
I need a case of corona to get me through 
I'll drink about anything if it makes me immune 
Because we're living on hot pockets the next six weeks
I need a case of corona to get me lip
Because my wife's homeschooling and losing her
I heard the Kwik-e-mart still has some left if you want to
So let's all get a case of corona 

[Verse 2]
All the toilet paper it isn't getting used 
And Netflix feels like pay-per-view
I've been mowing the yard
I've been washing my truck
I want to lockdown like I want a kick in the nuts 

[Chorus]
I need a case of corona to get me through 
I'll drink about anything if it makes me immune 
Because we're living on hot pockets the next six weeks
I want a case of corona to get me lip
Because my wife's homeschooling and losing her
I heard the Kwik-e-mart still has some left if you want to
So let's all get a case of corona 
So let's all get a case of corona 
So let's all get a case of corona 

The beer, not the virus 
Just so we're clear 
Let's all get a case of corona
