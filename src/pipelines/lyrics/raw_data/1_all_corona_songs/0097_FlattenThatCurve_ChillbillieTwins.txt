[Verse 1]
I left my home about a quarter to four
Looking for toilet paper and there isn't no more
We got the coronavirus blues 
Yeah the coronavirus blues 
Oh, Lord please help us 
We got the coronavirus blues 

[Verse 2]
No hand sanitizer, no alcohol
We need Cora Kwaps but who do we call
Got the coronavirus blues 
Yeah the coronavirus blues
Oh, Lord please help us 
We got the coronavirus blues 

[Verse 3]
Self quaranting is called the birds 
But I do it just to flatten the curve 
I said I flatten the curve
Yeah, flatten that curve 
Oh, Lord please help us 
We got the coronavirus blues 

[Verse 4]
If you want a usual eat-out
Use the Drive-thru 
Support your local business
That's what we got to do
And we'll all get through it
We're going to get through it 
We'll all get through it
Yeah we'll get right through it 
Oh, Lord please help us 
We got the coronavirus blues

[Verse 5]
We're all together, we're in the same boat 
We got to keep it on a positive note 
I said a positive note 
Yeah, positive note
Oh, Lord please help us 
We got the coronavirus blues

[Spoken Outro]
Now go wash your hands
