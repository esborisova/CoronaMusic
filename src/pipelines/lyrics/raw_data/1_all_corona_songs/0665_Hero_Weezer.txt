[Verse 1]
When I was a kid, I thought I'd save the world
Running around and chasing all the criminals
Swinging on a web, flying in the sky
Shooting lasers from my eyes
But now I know it never was my destiny
It's not my place in life, not who I'm meant to be
And I don't need the glory, I don't need the fame
And I don't wanna wear this cape

[Pre-chorus]
‘Cause on the inside
I know it won't last
On the inside
I'm an outcast

[Chorus]
Well, everybody needs a hero 
But I'm not everybody else
I walk alone
Yeah, I walk alone 
Yeah, I walk alone, yeah
You know I tried to be a hero 
But I was lying to myself
I walk alone
Yeah, I walk alone 
Yeah, I walk alone, yeah

[Verse 2]
They build you up and then they're gonna tear you down
They love you then they hate you, if you wear a crown
It’s not that I don’t love to solve a mystery
But life is hard enough with one identity
If silence is the voice of a new generation
Then I could live up to all of your expectations
I'd hammer down hard like I'm Iron Fist
Then disappear like I don't exist

[Pre-chorus]
And on the inside
I know it won't last
On the inside
I'm an outcast

[Chorus]
Well, everybody needs a hero 
But I'm not everybody else
I walk alone
Yeah, I walk alone yeah, I walk alone, yeah
You know I tried to be a hero 
But I was lying to myself
I walk alone
Yeah, I walk alone 
Yeah, I walk alone, yeah

[Solo: Guitar]

[Chorus]
Well, everybody needs a hero 
But I'm not everybody else
I walk alone
Yeah, I walk alone 
Yeah, I walk alone, yeah
You know I tried to be a hero 
But I was lying to myself
I walk alone
Yeah, I walk alone 
Yeah, I walk alone, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, everybody needs a hero 
But I'm not everybody else
I walk alone
Yeah, I walk alone 
Yeah, I walk alone, yeah
You know I tried to be a hero 
But I was lying to myself
I walk alone
Yeah, I walk alone 
Yeah, I walk alone, yeah
