[Verse 1]
How about taking a moment to thank the frontline 
How about thinking of others who can't stay at home 
How about fighting to get these workers protection 
How about standing up for the ones we love

[Chorus]
Thank you doctors 
Thank you nurses
Thanks for working the frontline
Thank you scientists 
Thank you pharmacists 
Thanks for working overtime 

[Verse 2]
How about reigning it in got the bigger picture
How about putting another before yourself 
How about appreciating what we took for granted 
Everything
How about slow clapping those who are soldiering on 

[Chorus]
Thank you Amazon 
Thank you grocery clerks 
Thank you all night truck drivers
Thank you janitors
Thanks, mail carriers 
Thank you selfless volunteers

[Bridge]
The moment we can all buckle down 
The sooner the moment this all will be over 
There's so many ways to help out 
Let us start by giving thanks, thanks

[Verse 3]
To everyone who's sick, we're sending you love
To everyone who's struggling, I feel you
I so do
How about governing without all of the politics 
How about working together for the greater good 

[Chorus]
Thank you garbage men 
And firewomen 
Teachers holding class online 
Thank you companies 
Changing strategies 
To make more medical supplies 

Factory workers 
First responders 
Civil service employees 
Thank you farmers
Thank you journalists 
Than you military 

Bless the unemployed 
The house workers 
And the work at home parents 

[Outro]
Thank you
Thank you
