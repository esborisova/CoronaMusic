[Verse 1]Hello it’s me I’ve been wondering after quarantine, if you and I can meet? To go over everything They say that time’s supposed heal youI guess we’ll wait and see [Verse 2]Hello can you hear me I’m in isolation dreaming about how it used to be When we were younger, and free And I’ve forgotten how it felt before we had Covid-19! There’s such a distance, between us And it seems a million miles[Chorus]Hello from the inside I wish I could come outside! To see you and hug you I’ve been waiting so long To come out and be normal I can’t live life online anymoreHello from the inside I wish I could come outside! To see you and hug you I’ve been waiting so long To come out and be normal I can’t live life online anymore
