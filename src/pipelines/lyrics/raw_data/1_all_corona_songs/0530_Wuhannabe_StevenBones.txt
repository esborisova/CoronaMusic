[Verse 1]
Yo, what's coming from Wuhan 
That you really don't want?
What is coming from Wuhan
That I really don't want?
A virus from Wuhan
That's what I really don't want
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want
I want a mask
I want a mask
I want a mask
I want a mask
I wanna really not die from coronavirus

[Verse 2]
If you want a future
Get yourself a mask
If you wanna put a mask on me
Better make it fast
Now don't go traveling
Around Wuhan, China
Coronavirus is spreading
Exercise caution 

[Chorus]
Yo, a virus from Wuhan 
Which I really don't want
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want
I want a mask
I want a mask
I want a mask
I want a mask
I wanna really not die from coronavirus 
If you survive this virus
Then we can still be friends
If you get coronavirus
Our friendship might just end
If you don't catch this virus
You will get to live
But try and take it easy
You're probably not at risk

[Verse 4]
Got a message on WhatsApp
Yo, it's probably not real
Please use some common sense
It's not the end of the world
Now don't go crazy
And don't get too stressed
'Cause anything can kill you
If you give it a chance

[Chorus]
Yo, a virus from Wuhan 
Which I really don't want
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want
I want a ah
I want a ah 
I want a ah
I want achoo
I wanna really not die from coronavirus
If you survive this virus
Then we can still be friends
If you're eaten by a lion
Our friendship might just end
If you don't catch this virus
You will get to live
But try and take it easy
And keep yourself clean

[Bridge]
So here's the story from A to Z
Don't wanna get disease
Then keep it sanitary
In a high risk place
Wash hands and cover face
If you really need to sneeze
Close mouth and don't spread disease
It could come for me
Don't spray it at me
And quarantine if you're feeling nasty
Don't put your hands inside your mouth
After wiping your butt
Hand inside your mouth 
After wiping your butt

[Chorus]
If you survive this virus
Then we can all still be friends
If you catch coronavirus
Our friendship might just end
If you don't catch this virus
You will get to live
Wash your hands and stay safe
Don't be too stupid

[Bridge]
If you don't wanna catch this virus
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta
Wash your hands, hands, hands
Don't put your hand inside your mouth
After wiping your butt
Hand inside your mouth
After wiping your butt
Eh, who really does that?
That's disgusting, okay
Hand inside your mouth
After wiping your butt
Wash your hands now
And put on a mask
Eh, but seriously, ah
Don't just take care of hygiene now 
When there's a virus now, okay?
Even when there's no virus
You should take care of your hygiene also
To prevent the spread of more disease, okay?
If you survive this virus
Also, if you need any medical advice
Please ask an actual doctor
Don't simply become a doctor by yourself, okay?
Because that's a different kind of smart
You understand or not?
So good luck and take care
