[Verse 1]
Struck by lightning sounds pretty frightening
But you know the chances are so small
Stuck by a bee sting nothing but a bee thing
Better chance you're going to buy it at the mall
But it's twenty-three or four to one that you could fall in love by the end of this song
So, get up, get up tell the bookie: "put a bet up"
Not a damn thing will go wrong

[Chorus]
The odds are that we'll probably be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright tonight
Odds are that we'll probably be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright for another night

[Verse 2]
Hit by the A-Train, crashed in an airplane
I wouldn't recommend either one
Killed by a Great White or a meteorite
I guess there isn't a way to go that's fun
But somewhere in the world someone is gonna fall in love by the end of this song
So, get up, get up, no it's never going to let up
So, you might as well sing along

[Chorus]
The odds are that we'll probably be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright tonight
Odds are that we'll probably be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright for another night

[Bridge]
Sure, things go wrong, but I'll take my chances
Odds are long, so why not stay?

[Verse 3]
Struck by lightning sounds pretty frightening
But you know the chances are so small
Hit by the A-Train crashed in an airplane
Better chance you're gonna buy it at the mall
It's twenty-three or four to one that you could fall in love by the end of this song
So, get up, get up no, I'm never going to let up
So, you might as well sing along

[Chorus]
The odds are that we'll probably be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright tonight
Odds are that we'll probably be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright, alright

[Outro]
The odds are that we'll probably be alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
The odds are that we'll probably be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright
Odds are we're gonna be alright for another night
