[Verse 1]When you’re down and troubled And you’re stuck in quarantine And nothing, oh nothing is going right Just scroll the Facebook news feed‘cause I’ll likely be there Posting some meme to brighten your darkest night [Chorus]If you’ll just send me a private message Or a text then wherever I am I’ll come running, oh yeah babyTo write you again And if we’re still at home in summer or fall All you’ve got to do is call And I’ll be there, yes I willYou’ve got a friend [Verse 2]When the sky above you May be filled with someone’s sneeze And you know you’ve got to slow the spreading of disease Just keep your head together now Don’t go out but for necessitiesIf you’re bored as hell at home, you might as well call me [Chorus]If you’ll just send me a private message Or a text then wherever I am I’ll come running, oh yeah babyTo write you again And if we’re still at home in summer or fall All you’ve got to do is call And I’ll be there, yes I will‘Cause you’ve got a friend[Bridge]Ain’t I good to have digital friend?People can be unsanitary They’ll ignore the plea of the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAnd they’ll shake your hand if you let them But don’t you let them [Chorus]You just send me a private message Or a text and wherever I am I’ll come running, oh yeah babyTo write you again If we’re still at home in summer or fall All you’ve got to do is call And I’ll be there, yes I willIf you need a friendIf you need a friendAin’t it good to know you’ve got a friend?Ain’t it good to know you’ve got a friend?
