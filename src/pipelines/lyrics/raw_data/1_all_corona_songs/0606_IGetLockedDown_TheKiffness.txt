[Chorus]
I get locked down
I want banana bread
Banana's looking pretty brown
So in lockdown
I make banana bread
While chilling in my dressing gown

[Chorus]
I get locked down
I want banana bread
Banana's looking pretty brown
So in lockdown
I make banana bread
While chilling in my dressing gown

[Verse 1]
Losing my mind today
Drink all the wine today
I drink a whiskey drink
I drink a risky drink
I drink a lager drink
I drink a cider drink
I sing the songs that remind me of the good times
I sing the songs that remind me of the better times
Ooh, lazy boy, watching Toy Story four

[Chorus]
I get locked down
I want banana bread
Banana's looking pretty brown
So in lockdown
I make banana bread
While chilling in my dressing gown

[Chorus]
I get locked down
I want banana bread
Banana's looking pretty brown
So in lockdown
I make banana bread
While chilling in my dressing gown

[Solo: Trumpet]
