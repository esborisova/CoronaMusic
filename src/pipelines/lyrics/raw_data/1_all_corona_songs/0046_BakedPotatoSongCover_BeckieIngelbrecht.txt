[Intro]
Hello
Baked Potato changed my life
Baked Potato showed me the way
If you want to know what is wrong from right
You must listen to what Potato say

[Verse 1]
Wash your hands and stay indoors
Thank you Baked Potato
Only go to grocery stores
Thank you Baked Potato
And if you want to have a better day
You must listen to what the Baked Potato say

[Verse 2]
Keep some distance
Make some space
Thank you Baked Potato
Remember not to touch your face
Thank you Baked Potato
If you want to have a better day
You must listen to what the Baked Potato say

[Outro]
