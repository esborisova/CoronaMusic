[Verse 1]
Hey corona, please don't kill my family
I ain't ready for another fucking tragedy
That'll be me that you see running past you
Won't shake hands, 'cause I'm carrying my pasta
Faster, faster, get out my way
Laughter, laughter, I hear them say
"Get a fucking grip, it's just like the flu"
Yeah, but it isn't so fuck you
Mortality rate is over three percent
The flu is null point one percent, you're fucking dense
I don't mean to be mean but I need to vent
You'll look real cool ' till you're fucking dead
"Only if you're old, this virus will stop you"
Yeah, tell that to the Chinese doctors
"Well fuck me Tom, what can we do?"
Wash your hands well the way I show you
Running warm water and anti-bac soap
Wash front to the back or you're a dope
Get between your fingers and around your thumbs
Don't forget your wrists or you're fucking dumb
How long should you wash your hand for, you reckon?
The NHS recommends at least 20 seconds
Set yourself a timer, make sure you're checking
If we don't stay clean then it won't stop spreading
I don't mean to cause a panic
But the situation's tragic
Everybody's acting manic
Catch it, kill it, bin it, magic
That's the only way we slow this novel virus COVID-19
Stay clean, upkeep your hygiene 
You will probably recover
You're a healthy motherfucker
Other brothers losing mothers
Mothers losing children that are sick
Sounds shit, right?
Well, it's true
It's still fucking bad even if it's not for you
So please don't be massive prick
Just try and be considerate
They'll die and I'm not mocking it
Seriously, people are at risk
"But I don't care, I'm much to cool
I send my poorly kids straight into school
I don't care about you, I care about me
You're just jealous of my life, can you even ski?"
Bitch please, can we lose the egos?
Not everything and anything is all about you, bro
This shit's moving fast and man, we move slow
Take a week off work and look after Hugo
I'm not telling you to panic, but take precautions
Wash your hands, stay clean, that's what's important
Stock up on supplies you might need
That'll help you survive COVID-19
