[Post-chorus]
Together, we're there for each other every time
Together, together, come on let's do this right
Together, we're there for each other every time
Together, together, come on let's do this right

[Verse 1]
Here and now it's time for celebration
I finally figured it out
That all our dreams have no limitations 
That's what it's all about

[Verse 2]
Everyone is special in their own way
We make each other strong 
We're not the same 
We're different in a good way
Together's where we belong

[Chorus]
We're all in this together 
Once we know, that we are
We're all stars and we see that
We're all in this together 
And it shows when we stand
Hand in hand 
Make our dreams come true
Everybody now!

[Post-chorus]
Together, together, together everyone 
Together, together, come on let's have some fun
Together, We're there for each other every time
Together, together, come on let's do this right

[Verse 3]
We're all here and speaking out with one voice
We're going to rock the house 
The party's on now everybody make some noise 
Come on scream on shout

[Verse 4]
We've arrived because we've stuck together 
Champions one and all

[Chorus]
We're all in this together 
Once we know, that we are
We're all stars and we see that
We're all in this together 
And it shows when we stand
Hand in hand 
Make our dreams come true

[Bridge 1]
Wild cats sing along 
Yeah, you really got it going on 
Wild cats in the house
Everybody say it now 
Wild cats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air 
That's the way we do it 
Let's get to it
Time to show the world 

[Chorus]
We're all in this together 
When we reach, we can fly
Know inside, we can make it
We're all in this together 
Once we see, there's a chance
That we have and we take it 

[Bridge 2]
Wild cats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air 
That's the way we do it 
Let's get to it
Come on everyone
