
[Intro]
You can’t touch this 
You can’t touch this 
You can’t touch this 
Can’t touch this 

[Verse 1]
My, my coronavirus hits me so hard 
All the teachers say oh my lord  
COVID is stressing me, all the update from the CDC
Lysol can’t be found, I’ve looked all around this town 
I’ve had no luck and these are things, huh
You can’t touch this 

[Hook: Spoken]
I told you students 
You better pull that mask up 
It’s the CDC, not me
Aye, go wash your hands 

[Verse 2]
Fresh new rules and plans
Let’s all be safe go wash your hands  
So move, back up six feet 
You better not cough, and you better not sneeze 
Sanitation, hold on
Let me check your temperature not under your arm 
Like that, like that, you’re all clear go to the back 
Everybody says that this is too much 
And these are things huh
You can’t touch this 

[Hook: Spoken]
Yo, I told you 
Why are you all standing so close, back up
Ugh 

[Verse 3]
Every time you see me Dr. Lee is sanitized 
I’m gonna keep my hands cleaned because the cases are on the rise 
Now why would I ever stop doing this
While others getting ill, I don’t wanna be sick 
I’ve been to al the classrooms from upstairs and to the gym 
It’s Lee, go Lee, Dr. Lee, yo Doctor 
Your late look at the clock 

[Hook]
Can’t touch this  
Can’t touch this  
Break it down 

[Breakdown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Six feet 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Stop, sanitize 

[Outro]
