Now that's what I call a Corona Christmas

I'm socially distanced
I've got my gear on
The lockdown was over

Christmas hit after Christmas hit
Lovingly ruined to help you not celebrate this Christmas

No I can't stay
Oh baby, there's Covid outside

In case the cops turn up
Fine us all a thousand pounds
And kick us all outside

Four months of school
Free school meals
Two weeks at home
Stay apart from your family

Stop the cabinet briefings

The perfect antidote to 2020

Maybe it's Covid, who's to say?
This cough won't go away
Can you stay six feet away?
