[Verse 1]
I love my grandma so much, of course
I know she loves me too
But thanks to this stupid virus
There are some new grandma rules

[Chorus]
Don't touch grandma
Leave her alone
You can spend a quarter 
to call her on the phone
'Cause grandmas like to pinch your cheeks
Kiss your head and hug
But I don't want my grandma 
catching any super bug
So don't touch grandma
And keep it to Zoom
Or learn to play canasta 
from across the room

[Verse 2]
Grandmas want to knit you sweaters
And to bake you cookies
But you must tell you grandma
No touchy, just looky

[Chorus]
Don't touch grandma
Give her some space
Even if your grandma
Wants to go to second base
And when this thing is over
You and she can play
But for now, 
You still can smell her grandma smell
From six feet away
