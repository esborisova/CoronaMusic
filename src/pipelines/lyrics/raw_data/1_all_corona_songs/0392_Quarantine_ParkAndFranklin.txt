[Verse 1]I'm starting to wonder if there's zombies Maybe they're out there eating brains On the surface that might sound kind of bad Functionally things all seem the same[Verse 2]Wonder what's going on in Italy What's going on in the city Rome I've been waiting so long to go out and play But the government took the ball and went home[Verse 3]Yeah, the market it sure fell today Yeah, the Dow Jones Industrial Average she took a dive Well for me not much has changed Gonna have to keep on working 'til I die	[Verse 4]Don't lend an ear to the ignorant Want to listen to the people in the know To the baby in the big house pay no never mind Want to listen to the World Health Organization[Verse 5]Just keep your wits about you Everything will turn out just fine Maybe when all this is said and done We'll have more to say than "I got mine"
