[Verse 1]
Baby they don't told us not to leave our homes
When I went to the Walmart, all the food was gone 
No TP in sight and I knew this was going wrong

[Verse 2]
It's doing something to me and I feel so strange 
We've been cooped up and I feel deranged 
I need me some snacks and I'm tired of staring at my phone 

[Bridge]
It's a virus kind and there ain't no vaccination
With those symptoms we need some medication 
We can avoid it together, uh-huh
Staying away from each other, uh-huh

[Chorus]
We've been quarantined
That is where we are
Locked up in our house 
Can't even drive a car 
Stay away from me 
I don't want your germs 
Or to cough on each other, uh-huh
Six feet away from one another, uh-huh

[Verse 3]
I'll be right there with you until the vax is gone
Baking spray each other with a can of Lasso
I ain't got no TP but I've got a couple of magazines

[Verse 4]
Kids are stir crazy and there ain't no doubt 
About to slap that oldest one in the mouth
If he keeps my, no [unsure]
Gonna see a side of me he never seen

[Bridge]
If we really need away
You know that we ain't tripping 
We can use some more newspaper clippings
Oh, cleaves are blooming, uh-huh [unsure]
Plenty of socks we can ruin, uh-huh

[Chorus]
We've been quarantined
That is where we are
Locked up in our house 
Can't even drive a car 
Stay away from me 
I don't want your germs 
Or to cough on each other, uh-huh
Six feet away from one another, uh-huh

[Outro]
Stay away
Stay away from me
Stay away, stay away
