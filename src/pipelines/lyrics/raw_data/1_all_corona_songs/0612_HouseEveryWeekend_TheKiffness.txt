[Verse 1]
I miss my friends
There's no need to fake it
I want to let my friends know
Let my friends know
Let my friends know
Let my friends know

[Chorus]
I've been chilling in my house every weekend
House every weekend
House every weekend
I chill hard in my house every weekend
House every weekend
House every weekend
I chill hard
