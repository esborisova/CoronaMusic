[Chorus]
Antibodies
Fill my body
Antibodies
Fill my body right
Covid's whack, let's fight
Let's fight

[Verse 1]
Coronavirus in the air
Invades my body like it just don't care
My antibodies kill it dead
Gonna wear a mask to stop the spread

[Pre-chorus]
Is my body strong? (Yeah)
Is it the only one? (Yeah)
To kill the virus dead? (Yeah)
My antibodies killed the virus
And I'm feeling stronger now

[Chorus]
Antibodies (Yeah)
Fill my body (Yeah)
Antibodies
Fill my body right
COVID's whack, let's fight
