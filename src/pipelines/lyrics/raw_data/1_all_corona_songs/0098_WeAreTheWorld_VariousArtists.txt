[Verse 1]
There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one 
There are people dying 
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change 
We are all apart of God's great big family 
And the truth, you know, love is all we need

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Oh, send them your heart, so they know that someone cares
So their cries for help will not be in vain
We can't let them suffer
No we cannot turn away
Right now, they need a helping hand 

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Verse 3]
When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe, there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well let us realize 
Oh, that a choice can only come
When we stand together as one 

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the world
We are the children, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the world
We are the children, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the world
We are the children, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day,
So let's start giving, let's start giving 
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the world
We are the children, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives, saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the world
We are the children, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, giving, giving, giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives, we are saving lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
