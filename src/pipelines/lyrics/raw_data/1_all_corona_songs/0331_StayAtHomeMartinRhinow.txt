[Verse 1]Life is full of music If you listen well Train your essential basics Learn from flowers smell Just keep unhappy days behind Keeps your sunny side in mind [Chorus]Today I will stay at home No-one will disturb my comfort zone I wanna read the news from start to end And write a song for my band Yeah won’t move any mile Won’t leave my house for a while [Verse 2]Everyone is busy No-one takes their time Stress will make you clumsy Stumbling while you climb Don’t want anymore complains I feel sick of all constrains [Chorus]Today I will stay at home No-one will disturb my comfort zone I wanna read the news from start to end And write a song for my band Yeah won’t move any mile Won’t leave my house for a while [Bridge]I will sit on my chair Chill around doing nothing I’m happy to be here (happy to be here)Get a melody and start to sing[Verse 3]Life is full of music If you listen well Train your essential basics Learn from flowers smell Just keep unhappy days behind Keeps your sunny side in mind [Chorus]Today I will stay at home No-one will disturb my comfort zone I wanna read the news from start to end And write a song for my band Yeah won’t move any mile Won’t leave my house for a while
