[Intro]It’s all still the same Everything’s untouched but forever changed Oh, we’re all still the same Everything’s untouched but forever changed[Verse 1]All those colors we painted yesterday  They look so different now And all those harmonies we sang yesterday All sound so different somehow  Though they’re all still the same Everything’s untouched but forever changed[Chorus]Everywhere on earth, every single soul, everyone there is, all together now And everyone alone all together on the precipice All that mattered then, all that matters now, all that matters after the world shuts down  All of it dissolved all together in the chrysalis Together in the chrysalis[Interlude][Verse 2]Nothing changes until one day it does then there’s no going back  Our best selves and our worst selves live in that moment there  Sparring over who draws the new maps And though their lines  May look the same  Everything depends on who wins that game[Chorus]Everywhere on earth, every single soul, everyone there is, all together now And everyone alone all together on the precipice All that mattered then, all that matters now, all that matters after the world shuts down  All of it dissolved all together in the chrysalis Together in the chrysalis[Bridge]And now the impossible's happening  A million knots that we were told can’t be untied  Would always hold all unraveling  And even while the heavens fall The fog's still wrapped around us all  And when it’s snuffed out every last star We’ll see just who we are[Outro]All together now, all together now, all together alone in the chrysalis  (We’re) all together now, all together now, all together alone in the chrysalisAll together now, all together now, all together alone in the chrysalis  (We’re) all together now, all together now, all together alone in the chrysalisAll together now, all together now, all together alone in the chrysalis  (We’re) all together now, all together now, all together alone in the chrysalisAll together now, all together alone
