[Verse 1]I bought a ticket for the long war around But it got cancelled I can’t go And I sure would like some sweet company But I can’t have my friends here anymore [Chorus]When it’s gone When COVID’s gone I sure won’t miss it it’s gone I guess we’re stuck here for a while And I’m still gonna choose to smile But I’m sure won’t miss it when it’s gone [Verse 2]I bought the last of Walmart’s toilet paper and beans What a nasty irony With the way I smell today I know I’m gonna be okay Because no one come within six feet of me  [Chorus]When it’s gone When COVID’s gone I sure won’t miss it it’s gone I guess we’re stuck here for a while And I’m still gonna choose to smile But I’m sure won’t miss it when it’s gone [Chorus]When it’s gone When COVID’s gone I sure won’t miss it it’s gone I guess we’re stuck here for a while And I’m still gonna choose to smile But I’m sure won’t miss it when it’s gone
