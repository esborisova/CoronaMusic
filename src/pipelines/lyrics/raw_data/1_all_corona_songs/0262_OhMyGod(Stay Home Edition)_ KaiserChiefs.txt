[Intro][Verse 1]Time on your own that’ll never end You’ve completed the internet and called all you friends Now you’re taking advice from a band named Kaiser Covering your body in in hand sanitizer It don’t matter to me Cause all that I wanted to be Was a million miles from here Somewhere unfamiliar Oooh [Verse 2]Thursday clapping for the NHS staff Then the weekend sitting in the park spreading pathogens Running round Lidl like an Andrex puppy Banana bread, baked potato, mango chutney It don’t matter to me Cause all that I wanted to be Was dancing round with Joe Wicks Dressing gown and glow sticks Oooh [Chorus]Oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home [Verse 3]Netflix better than an antibiotic Growing out my hair like Joe Exotic Get locked down, I’ll get right back up again Come out singing like a showy Hugh Jackman It don’t matter to me Cause all that I wanted to be Was sitting on social media Away from your bacteria Oooh [Chorus]Oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home [Solo: Guitar]Oooooh [Chorus]Oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home And oh my God, I can’t believe it I’ve never spent this much time at home
