[Chorus]
Everybody was kung flu fighting
Coronavirus go away
It's spreading fast as lightning
In fact it's really, really frightening
Coronavirus go away
It came in the worst timing

[Verse 1]
Now everybody please
Cover your mouth when you sneeze
I don't want this disease
I don't want to be deceased 
It's breaking people's hearts
It's more lethal than my farts
Wash your hands with soap
Epstein didn't hang himself with a rope

[Chorus]
Kung flu fighting
Coronavirus go away
