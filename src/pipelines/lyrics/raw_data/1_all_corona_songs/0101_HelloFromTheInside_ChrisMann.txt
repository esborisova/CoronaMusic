[Verse 1]
Hello
It's me
I'm in California dreaming about going out to eat
Just a burger with cheese 
Or a shaken margarita, baby back ribs from Chillies

[Verse 2]
Hello, can you hear me?
I am shouting out to neighbors who I used to like to see
When we were outside and free
Is there something else to watch besides the news and Finding Dory

[Pre-chorus]
There's social distance between us 
And I'm freaking out 

[Chorus]
Hello from the inside 
It's just me and myself and I
And a stay home order that's breaking my heart 
But it's clearly what we should have done from the start 

Hello from corona life 
I've FaceTimed called a thousand times 
To show you I'm sitting right here on the couch 
What's the point of putting on pants anyhow
Anymore 

[Verse 3]
Hello
How are you?
Do your fingers hurt from scrolling through the cat memes on your iPhone 
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town before they closed the Costco
It's no secret that the both of us haven't showered yet

[Chorus]
Hello to corona life
They're saying stay home to July 
Jesus Christ Almighty can you please send me strength 
I'm so sick and tired of my own Goddamned face 

Hello from self quarantine, quarantine 
I'm begging Amazon to please, Amazon to please
After sending more soap, can you please figure out 
How to send a box of my friends to my house 

[Bridge]
I'm so bored, help, help, help, help
I'm so bored, help, help, help, help 
I'm so bored, help, help, help, help
I'm so bored, help, help, help, help 
I'm so bored, help, help, help, help

[Chorus]
Hello from the inside, the inside 
It's just me and myself and I, myself and I
And a stay home order that's breaking my heart 
But it's clearly what we should have done from the start 

Hello from corona life, corona life
I've FaceTimed called a thousand times, a thousand times 
To show you I'm sitting right here on the couch 
What's the point of putting on pants anyhow
Anymore
