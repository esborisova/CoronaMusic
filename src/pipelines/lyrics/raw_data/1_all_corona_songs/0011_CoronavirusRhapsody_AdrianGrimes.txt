[Intro]
Is this a fever?
Is this just allergies?
Caught in a lockdown
No escape from the family
Don't touch your eyes
Just hand-sanitize quickly
I'm just a poor boy
No job security
because of easy spread
Even though
I washed my hands
Laying low
I look out the window
The curve doesn't look flatter, to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, I just killed a man
I didn't stay inside in bed
I walked past him, now he's dead
Mama, life was so much fun
But now I've got this unforgiving plague
Mama, ooh,
I didn't mean to make them die
If I'm  not back to work this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if people didn't matter

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sent shivers down my spine
Social isolation time
Goodbye, everybody
I hope it's just the flu
I've got to leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, 
Just look out your window
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I never went out at all

[Solo: Guitar]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhoutte of a man
What a douche, what a douche
Did he even wash his hands
No toilet paper frightening
Very very frightening me
Gotta lay low, gotta lay low, gotta lay low, gotta lay low, gotta lay low, masturbate
I'm just a poor boy facing mortality
He's just a poor boy facing mortality
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Touch your face, wash your hands
Will you wash your hands?
Bismillah! No! We will not wash our hands
Wash your hands!
Bismillah! We will not wash our hands
Wash your hands!
Bismillah! We will not wash our hands
Wash your hands! Will not wash our hands
Wash your hands!
Never, never wash our hands! Never no
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
Oh mama mia, Mama mia
Mama mia, wash your hands
Covid-19 has a sickness put aside for me, for me, for me

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stop me and just shake my hand?
So you think we can hang out and not break our plans?
Oh, baby!
Can't do this with me, baby
Just gotta stay home
I hope I don't run out of beer

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh yeah!
Ooh yeah!
The curve could get much flatter
Anyone can see
The curve could get much flatter
You know it's your responsibility
Just look out your window
