[Verse 1]Imagine there’s no virusIt isn’t hard to do No panic buyers Self-isolation too Imagine all the people Sharing no more germs Ah[Verse 2]Imagine there’s no bog rollWhen you need a pooNo hand sanitizer And Boris Johnson tooImagine all the people Whipping with the Sun News [Chorus]You may say I’m a hoarder But my shopping weights a tone I hope some day you’ll join us And the non-perishables with all be gone [Verse 3]Imagine no pandemicHad started in Wuhan Sold out of bleach and nappies And paracetamol Imagine all the people Sharing no disease You[Chorus]You may say I’m a cleaner But the disinfectant’s gone I hope some day you’ll clean us And the germs will be all done
