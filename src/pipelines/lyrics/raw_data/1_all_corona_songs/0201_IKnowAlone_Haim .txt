[Verse 1]Been a couple days since I’ve been out Calling all my friends but they won’t pick up Found another room in a different place Sleeping through the day and I dream the same[Pre-chorus]I don’t wanna give, I don’t wanna give too much I don’t wanna feel, I don’t wanna feel at all[Chorus] 'Cause nights turn into days That turn to grey Keep turning over Some things never grow I know alone like no one else doesSome things never change They never fade It’s never over Some things never grow I know alone like no one else does[Verse 2]Been a couple days since I’ve been around Woke up at the wheel on the edge of town It all looked the same every mile Screaming every word of “both sides now”[Pre-chorus]I don’t wanna give, I don’t wanna give too much I don’t wanna feel, I don’t wanna feel at all[Chorus] 'Cause nights turn into days That turn to grey Keep turning over Some things never grow I know alone like no one else doesSome things never change They never fade It’s never over Some things never grow I know alone like no one else does[Instrumental] 
[bridge](When Sunday comes they expect me to shine)Days get slow like counting cell towers on the road I know alone and I don’t wanna talk about it Friday hits and I feel like wasting everybody’s time When Sunday comes they expect me to shine (When Sunday comes they expect me to shine)(When Sunday comes they expect me to shine)When Sunday comes they expect me to shine [Instrumental] [Outro](When Sunday comes they expect me to shine)I know alone(When Sunday comes they expect me to shine)I know alone I know alone Some things never change They never fade (I know alone, I know alone)Some things never grow I know alone(I know alone, I know alone, I know alone, I know alone, I know alone…)
