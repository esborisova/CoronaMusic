[Intro]
I know I'm not alone

[Verse 1]
Unconscious mind
I wanna know
Wanna feel one last time
Never let me go

[Chorus]
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere whenever
Apart we're still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

[Instrumental]
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

[Verse 2]
Lost in your mind
I'm wide awake
Am I losing my mind
Take my pain away

[Chorus]
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere whenever
Apart we're still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

[Instrumental]
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
