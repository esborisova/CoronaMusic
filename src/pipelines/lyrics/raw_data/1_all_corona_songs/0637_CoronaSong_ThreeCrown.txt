[Verse 1]
Recently there's a very bad virus
It's name is Corona
Where's it from? Its hometown is Wuhan
All was calm, and then a breakout
We all should stay on our toes
To not let it spread
Let's stay determined
So this disease won't catch fire

[Chorus]
You gotta wash your hands and rub rub rub them
Don't put them on your eyes or your nose or your mouth
Don't go into crowded places
Fight against corona, corona
Wash your hands and rub rub rub them
Don't put them on your eyes or your nose or your mouth
Don't go into crowded places
Fight against Corona, Corona
Corona, corona
Corona, corona

[Verse 2]
Though it's small, it's very cruel
It's killing folks all over the world
Times are tough, we're working hard
To keep this thing from getting worse
We all should stay on our toes
To not let it spread
Let's stay determined
So this disease won't catch fire

[Chorus]
You gotta wash your hands and rub rub rub them
Don't put them on your eyes or your nose or your mouth
Don't go into crowded places
Fight against corona, corona
Wash your hands and rub rub rub them
Don't put them on your eyes or your nose or your mouth
Don't go into crowded places
Fight against corona, corona
Corona, corona
Corona, corona

[Verse 3]
If we're ready today
Then tomorrow we will stand firm
Our hearts are not deterred
Let's fight against corona, corona
If we're ready today
Then tomorrow we will stand firm
Our hearts are not deterred
Let's fight against corona, corona
Corona, corona
