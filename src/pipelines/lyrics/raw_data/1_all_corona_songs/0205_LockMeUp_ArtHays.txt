[Intro]
If you lock me up
If you lock me up, the spread will stop 
If you lock me up
If you lock me up, the spread will stop 

[Verse 1]
COVID’s running hot 
Kids on the beach are sharing what they got 
If you lock me up 
If you lock me up, the spread will stop, spread will stop, 
spared will stop, spread will stop 

[Chorus]
Can’t make Corona cry 
Can’t make the virus die 
Just one thing left to try 
Ran out of masks, got no vaccine 
Screw social distance, it’s full quarantine 
Lock me up 

[Verse 2]
If you lock me up 
Click on the Netflix just watch all they got, they got, they got 
I’m gonna scream 
With those kiddos out of school for weeks 
If you vomit up
Can’t get a test now, they ain’t got enough, got enough, got enough,
Got enough 

[Chorus] 
You make Corona cry 
Can’t make a virus die 
My wallet is running dry 
Ain’t got no work 
I’m losing green 
Anyone listening down 
Washington DC 
Pay it up 

[Verse 3]
Lock me up
China gave it all they got 
They got that awesome super-duper lock 
Dried it up, woo 
Aww, they fried it up, tied it up 

[Chorus] 
You make Corona cry 
Can’t make the virus die 
Please, don’t you go outside 
Vegas stripped, .???. on downtown L.A. 
?Not a hell to see? 


[Outro] 
Lock me up 
Till the day that we can get a shot, get a shot, get a, get a shot 
Lock me up
The spread will stop, spread will stop 
You, you 
Can’t make Corona cry
You, you 
Can’t make the virus run
You, you 
Can’t make the virus run
