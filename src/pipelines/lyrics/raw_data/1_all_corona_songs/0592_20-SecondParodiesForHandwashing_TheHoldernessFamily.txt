[Verse 1]
Here I go, here I go, here I go again
Guys, what are you washing?
Hands
Yeah, you'll be scrubbing, rubbing
Disinfecting
Use the hot water, it's more effective
Can't forget to get the back of your hands, nope
So what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
I wanna soap soap soap

[Verse 2]
Hands
Don't be touching hands
Please don't be reaching out
Don't be touching me
And I won't touch you
Hand washing time

[Verse 3]
Get the soap into a foam for you
Don't forget to clean 
In between the fingers
Scrub so hard you're like blah blah blah
Scrub it and wash it off with water
Is it worth it?
De-germ it
Rub your hands down, flip them and reverse it

If you got a pump bottle, you better squirt it
Sometimes it doesn't come out, so twerk it

[Verse 3]
When you make suds
Do you look in the mirror?
What do you think of?
Is it the CDC?
Ooh, yeah
I don't wanna touch you too much baby
But if I do I'll wash my hands like crazy
Scrub nice
Scrub deep
Do it repeatedly

[Verse 4]
So you think you can just use your pant legs to dry?
There are germs on those pant legs so don't even try
Ooh baby
Maybe air dry it baby
Or there's a clean towel 
Or there's a clean towel right here

[Spoken word]
Alright
Hope you guys got the message
There are lots of twenty second songs out there 
Even a 40 second song, if you need that
So thanks for watching
And remember

[Verse 5]
Washing really matters
Every time you pee
Washing really matters
Washing really matters to me
