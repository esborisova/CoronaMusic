[Intro]AaahAaahOh Yeah[Chorus]Don’t touch your face Don’t touch your eyes You’ve got to sanitize Ooh, every same routine You are in quarantine AaaahAaaah[Verse 1]Friday night there’s nowhere to go‘Cause they want you to stay at home All about social distance Keep six feet away You’re in pajamas all day What’s the newsWhat’s going onWhy is all the toilet paper goneCabin fever is starting What is there to doYou’re in the mood for a dance But you won’t get the chance [Chorus]You are in quarantine All because of COVID-19 Quarantine, wash your hands Keep them nice and clean Oh yeah Don’t touch your face Don’t touch your eyes You’ve got to sanitize Ooh, every same routine You are in quarantine AaahAaah You are in quarantine Everyday same routine You are in quarantine
