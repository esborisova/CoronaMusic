[Spoken words]I don’t get how a world that makes such wonderful things could become this. [Verse 1]Look at my house Isn’t it clean My hygiene’s on fleek ‘Cause of COVID-19I’m such a miserable girl The girl who’s in quarantine I’ve got Disney Plus streamed on my television I’ve watched Frozen, Aladdin and Thor You want toilet paper?I’ve got plenty But no masks They’re sold out I need more [Verse 2]I wanna be where the people are I want cute guys to take me dancing Walking around on those – what do you call them again?Oh, streetsStaying at home you get really boredZoom is required for human contact Walking around without What’s that distance – what’s that distance?Oh yeah, six feet [Chorus]I wanna walk I wanna run I wanna tan all day in the sun Corona freeI want to be Part of outside [Verse 3]I bet they’ll extend This lockdown won’t end Bet they don’t reopen their bordersDesperate women missing shopping Ready to spend I’ve read Harry Potter like a thousand times I dream of a world without COVID-19Meeting a person and hearing them What’s the word? – Burp[Chorus]That human touchThose friends to seeBut not on Facetime or house party Two weeks to wait Unless they once again change that date And I’ll still beStuck here inside
