[Intro]It feels like ages that I’ve been stuck inside How many more days of this can I take?How many more months before the world is awake? How many more? [Verse 1]How many more days? How many more hours?How many more moths? How many more seconds?How many more?How many more before..[Chorus]I can be outsideFeel the wind on my face I can walk on by and feel natures embrace How many more? How many more?How many more?How many more?I wanna stand in a meadow and get dirt on my apples Picking the sweetest potatoes, looking like Robert De NiroOn a holiday, everybody wants to go on holiday, yeahAin’t nothing gonna stop me from going out [Verse 2]Won’t you take to a place where there’s no more masksWhere I can see the face of the man who asks why I’m not wearing a mask in the first place In the first place [Outro]How many more lockdowns will there be?
