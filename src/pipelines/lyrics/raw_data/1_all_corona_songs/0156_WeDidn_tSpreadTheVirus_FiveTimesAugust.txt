[Verse 1]
Democrats, Republicans, Indepependents, everyone
Wash your hands, stay inside
Make sure the world is sanitized
Shut it down, lock your doors
Is cancel culture getting bored?
Nothing left for us to do
But sit at home and watch the news

[Chorus]
We didn’t spread the virus
‘Cause we were all at home, we had nowhere to go
No, we didn’t spread the virus
We all just stayed at home, kept playing on our phone

[Verse 2]
Made it to the grocery store
No toilet paper anymore
I guess that’s what we need the most?
I don’t know why, that’s kind of gross
Frozen pizza, lunchables
Shopping baskets looking full
Stocking up on all the seeds
I’ll save the world by gardening

[Chorus]
We didn’t spread the virus
‘Cause we were all at home, we had nowhere to go
No, we didn’t spread the virus
‘Cause we were all at home, just playing on our phones

[Verse 3]
No more South by Southwest
No more Disneyland I guess
No more basketball events
All eyes on the President
Facebook full of scientists
Amazing, I did not know this!
All the posts and all the memes 
And government conspiracies

[Chorus]
We didn’t spread the virus
‘Cause we were all at home, we had nowhere to go
We didn’t spread the virus
We all just stayed at home, kept playing on our phones
Our phones, at home, alone, at home, on all our phones
