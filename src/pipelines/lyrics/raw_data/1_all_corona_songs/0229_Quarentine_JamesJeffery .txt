[Verse 1]When I find myself away from classesThe Health Department comes to me Speaking words of warning, quarantine And in my hour of freedom A nasty truth is right in front of me We must take precautions, quarantine [Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, can’t be seen, quarantine We must take precautions, quarantine [Verse 2]I haven’t seen my friends in weeks I hope that they remember me Got to keep my chin up, quarantine Everything that I’d looked forward to doWas canceled right in front of me Keep a little grin on, quarantine [Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, thanks to COVID-19Hope that we get out soon, quarantine Quarantine, quarantine, thanks to COVID-19Hope that we get out soon, quarantine[Solo: Piano][Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, thanks to COVID-19I hope that we get out soon, quarantine[Verse 3]And when the Dow is fallingAnd they empty out the Treasury Still hopeful for tomorrow, quarantine I wake up to the sound of knocking Mother dearest comes to me Come on, I made pancakes, quarantine [Chorus] Quarantine, quarantine, thanks to COVID-19There will be an answer, quarantineQuarantine, quarantine, thanks to COVID-19There will be an answer, quarantineQuarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantineThere will be an answer, quarantine
