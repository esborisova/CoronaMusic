[Verse 1]
I see coronavirus rising
I see politicians making hay
I see boomers acting frightened
I see the stocks have crashed today

[Chorus]
Don't go out tonight
Because you probably won't die
There's corona on the rise

[Verse 2]
I hear the media exploding
I know they're mostly just buffoons
I fear economy that's slowing
I hear my neighbour getting poon

[Chorus]
Don't go out tonight
Because you probably won't die
There's corona on the rise

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I hope you've got your toilet paper
I hope your grannies do not die
Looks like, we're binging shows together
Watching the betas game online

[Chorus]
Don't go out tonight 
Because you probably won't die
There's corona on the rise 

[Chorus]
Don't go out tonight 
Because you probably won't die
There's corona on the rise
