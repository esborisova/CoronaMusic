[Intro]
One, two, three
Ooh, wap, wap
Ooh, wap, wap
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I just want to see my friends
I want to walk the street again
But I got to be patient
So let's enjoy this confination

[Verse 2]
I just wanna feel your love
Because Instagram is not enough for me
So I got to be patient
Let's enjoy this confination

[Bridge]
And every day we'll sing a song
To make you dance
Until this ends

[Verse 4]
I just want to see my friends
I want to walk the streets again
So I got to be patient
Let's enjoy this confination

[Verse 5]
Si
Tienes ganas de salir
Lo siento, pero no
Tienes que quedarte allí
Pero cuando canto esta canción
Ahí me brilla el corazón
Y me siento muy feliz

[Bridge]
And every day we'll sing a song
To make you dance
Until this ends

[Verse 6]
I just want to see my friends
I want to walk the streets again, again
But I got to be patient
So let's enjoy this confination

[Outro]
Every night and every day
So I got to be patient
Let's enjoy this confination
Woah ooh woah, ooh, ooh
I gotta be patient, I gotta be
So let's enjoy this confination, ooh
