[Verse 1]
Doctor's brought us into this world as babies
And doctors take good care of your grandma
Doctors always give you an old lollipop
After hitting your knee with a hammer
Nurses slap your arm 'till they find a good vein
They wear Crocs and they tell you the truth
Nurses give you ice packs and pain medication
While your doctor is smoking on the roof

[Chorus]
Doctors and nurses will save us from this mess
If we get them the supplies they need
And I hope they save us soon
'Cause I'm really, really sick of my family

[Verse 2]
If you're a nerd a doctor can give you a note
So in gym class you don't have to run the mile
School nurses give deodorant to sticky kids
So they're a little less stinky for a while
Good bless Italian doctors in Italy
And all the Spanish doctors in Spain
And God bless Chinese doctors in China
And also Chinese doctors in America

[Chorus]
We got to build some ventilators
And make more masks
We gotta do it now, so let's all come together
I'm teaching math to my kids
And that can't be good for America

[Bridge]
Stay home as much as you can
Make sure to wash your hands
Let's make this damn thing go away
We love you doctors and nurses
You're saving lives every day
Find a cure for this [bleep]
'Cause I really, really miss hugging my mailman
