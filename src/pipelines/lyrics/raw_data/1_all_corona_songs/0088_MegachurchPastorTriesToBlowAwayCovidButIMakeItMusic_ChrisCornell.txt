[Verse 1]
When, when
Almighty, almighty 
Strong, strong 
South wind, south wind
Heat, heat
Burn this thing, burn this thing
In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus
Shaking you by your knees, shaking you by your knees 
You fall on your face, you fall on your face
Covid nineteen
I'm blowing, I'm blowing 
The wind of god, the wind of god
On you, on you
