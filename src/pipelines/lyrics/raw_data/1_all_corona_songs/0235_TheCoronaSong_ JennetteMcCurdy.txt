[Verse 1]I am locked in a self-quarantine Thanks so much corona, the economy’s the worst we’ve seen And now my grandma thinks that she can justify hysteria she feels inside so she Takes eight more Ativan every day - I keep telling her grandma your body can’t handle it your eighty-two I guess I’m sort of doing the same What I mean to say is I’m just trying to tune out my brain I stay relaxed by watching everything Hulu and on Netflix and on Tru TV, and Pluto, and Disney Plus, and Quibbles, is that even out yet, what about Peacock, I can’t remember them all. I am truly terrified or when I’m no longer pacified ohBy every streaming service will I get what I deserve this might make me face myself a way that I haven’t before[Chorus]Oooh shitOooh shit Oooh shit Oh shit [verse 2]I don’t want to tune into my thoughts - where’s my career going, will I ever be paid to write and direct, I wish my grandpa hadn’t died before seeing me succeed. I don’t want to tune into my thoughtsAnd I don’t wanna front row seat to my feelings, yikes!And I don’t wanna stream my stream of consciousness I’d rather turn it off and just turn on Apple TV or Amazon Prime, or HBO Go or is there another HBO or two Jesus Christ[Chorus]Oooh shitOooh shit Oooh shit Oh shit [Verse 3]You know where there’s always YouTube Red Forget about facing myself I can always start watching [???] sure there’s not really anything I wanna watch on there but beats dealing with myself, yeah
