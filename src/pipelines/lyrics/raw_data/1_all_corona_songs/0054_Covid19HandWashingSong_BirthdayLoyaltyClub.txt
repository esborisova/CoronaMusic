[Verse 1]
If you do a bad job of washing your hands 
Then COVID-19o will ruin your plans
So follow these steps down to a T
To keep those meat clamps virus free

[Verse 2]
Now first things first, turn the water on
If you don't do that, there's no point to this song 
But your hands and elbows away you sneeze 
So don't use those, you got to use your knees

[Verse 3]
Now take those slappers and get them all wet
You can skip this step if you're dripping with sweat
Now that they're moist, please don't delay
Without some soap to wash the virus away

[Verse 4]
Once again use your knees to pump 
Soap into your hands so they don't smell like a dump 
To make sure you have enough be sure to count 
Ten pumps per hand is the suggested amount

[Verse 5]
One pump, two pumps, three pumps, four
Keep pumping that soap jizz into your claw
Speed it up you're taking way too long 
Please keep in mind you've left the water on

[Verse 6]
Now scrub the palms of both your mitts
Until the first layer of skin is flaking off in bits
Keep on scrubbing with your head held high
It's a sign of weakness if you start to cry

[Verse 7]
Next take your finger in a solid grip 
And slide from the base all the way to the tip
Then back down the shaft and increase the speed
Until the nail comes off and it starts to bleed

[Verse 8]
Repeat this step with each finger and thumb
Take a good hard look at what your life has become 
And take some steel wool or a pumice stone 
To the backs of your hands until you start to see bone 

[Verse 9]
Now rinse those grabbers as best as you can
Use your knee on the tap to turn it off again
Then blow on your hands until you're light in the head
And you collapse on the ground and bleed out until you're dead
