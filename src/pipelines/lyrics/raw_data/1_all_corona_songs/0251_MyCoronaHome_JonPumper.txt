[Intro]
Aruba, Jamaica, oh, I want to take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty, mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go
Cause we can’t

[Verse 1]
We’re in quarantine
In our own corona homes
That’s where you have to go to stay away from it all
Dinner’s from a can, afternoons coloring with crayons 
It’s been thirteen seconds since I last went to go wash my hands
In my corona home

[Chorus]
A Rubik’s, cornflake-ahs, don’t give me handshake-ahs
Please remove-ah, your mama, time to watch my dramas
No labor, no razor, out of toilet paper
In my corona home
I’ve spent the last few days all alone
Playing with styrofoam
In my corona home

[Verse 2]
My feet, they reek, haven’t showered in a week
Browsing online memes
Panic shopping for groceries
And by and by we’ll defy the guidelines from the CDC
Lost my appetite, cocktails during business Skypes
No one comes to socialize, it’s an introverted paradise
In my corona home

[Chorus]
No moolah, for take-out, oh, we shouldn’t make out
Haven’t changed my pajamas, learning how to samba
Nintendo, Lumbago, time to Marie Condo
In our corona homes
We shouldn’t ask how long this will go 
Don’t think we want to know
In our corona homes
