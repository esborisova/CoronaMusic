[Verse 1]
Social life has come and passed
Quarantine is where we're at
Stay at home 'till corona ends
Don't forget to wash your hands
We have to do everything we can
Gotta make this corona end

[Chorus]
There goes my investments
Falling off the charts
It feels like the end is near
All this breaks my heart

[Verse 2]
You feel like you're alone
But trust us and just stay at home
Wake me up when corona ends
