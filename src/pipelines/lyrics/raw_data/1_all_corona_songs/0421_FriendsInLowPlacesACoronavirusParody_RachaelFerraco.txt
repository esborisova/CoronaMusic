[Verse 1]We’re stuck in this house No body else I’m literally going insane Binging all the news shows and food’s running low Will my stocks slowly go down the drain I’m not getting paidI’m not getting laid I’ve lceaned every inch of this house I’m six feet away, got toilet paper for days When will we get out[Chorus]Oh, I’ve got no friends in isolation Had to say goodbye to my paid vacation QuarantineOh, you make me wanna scream And I think I’m having a hallucination ‘cause I haven’t moved from this one location Oh, I’ve got no friends in isolation [Interlude][Verse 2]And I’m working form home Always checking my phone Haven’t showered in days, won’t pretend Waiting on a vaccine while we practice hygiene When will this pandemic end The Olympics rescheduledMarch Madness was cancelled The Tony Awards have gone dark MLB, NHL, NBA, NFLWhen will they restart [Chorus]Oh, I’ve got no friends in isolation Can’t comprehend all of this frustration Quarantine Oh, you make me wanna scream And all the seniors are missing out on graduation ‘Cause they’re finishing class with online education Oh, I’ve got no friends in isolation [Chorus]Oh, I’ve got no friends in isolation Had to say goodbye to paid vacation Quarantine Oh, you make me wanna scream Yeah, and I think I’m having a hallucination ‘cause I haven’t moved from this one location Oh, I’ve got no friends in isolation
