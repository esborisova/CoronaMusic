[Verse 1]
Look around, everywhere you turn is COVID 
It’s everywhere that you go 
Just look around 
I know you tried 
Everything you can to escape 
The social distance shit show 
What a shit show
But just settle into the quarantine 
Flatten the corona curve 
They say the cure is up to you and me 
It’s called a sick day, so birch you better star home 

[Chorus]
Come on, stay home 
Home, home
Work remotely and Zoom your meetings 
And Zoom your meetings
Hey, hey, hey 
Come on, stay home 
Home, home 
Watch the television and eat you feelings 
And eat your feelings
You know you can do it 

[Verse 2]
All you need 
Is your own imagination
So use it, that’s what it’s for
Chris, tell me more 
Read a book, that’s the thing that’s filled with paper 
But I can’t tell you got sure 
I can’t say for sure
It makes no difference if you’re black or white 
Corona’s coming for you (oh shit)
Do the cool thing now and just stay inside 
You’re a hermit star
Yes, that’s what you are, you know it 

[Chorus]
Come on, stay home 
Home, home 
Work remotely and Zoom your meetings 
And Zoom your meetings
Hey, hey, hey 
Come on, stay home 
Home, home 
Watch the television and eat your feelings 
And eat your feelings
You know you can do it 

[Verse 3]
Home is where the heart is 
So forget you friends outside 
First day in feels like magic 
But soon you’ll be a bat-shit lunatic 
I’ve got to go 

[Spoken words]
Oh my God give me the fuck out of here 

No, isolation for the cure 
(stay home)
Home 
Home is where the heart is 
And Zoom your meetings

Ooh, you got to
You’ve got to

Stay home
