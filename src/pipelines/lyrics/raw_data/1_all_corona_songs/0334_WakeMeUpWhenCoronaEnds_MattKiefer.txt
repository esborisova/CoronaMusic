[Spoken words]If you’re abroad, it’s time for you to come home If you just arrived, you must self-isolate [Verse 1]Winter has come and past The wickedness can never last Wake me up when corona ends [Spoken words]As we come on [???] much of America shutting down [Verse 2]Like my father’s come to pastThirty years has gone so fast Wake me up when corona ends [Spoken words]With thirteen hundred new cases in just the last twenty-four hours.[Chorus]Here comes the fear againFalling from the stars Washing my hands again Becoming who we areAs memory rest But never forget what is lost Wake me up when corona ends [Spoken words]I can’t believe what people are doing inside – shelves are empty. It’s like we’re going to – I don’t know where. You don’t have to buy so much – take it easy, just relax. These are sections nearly bare – here produce’s gone, cleaning products low, bleach totally bought out. [Verse 3]Winter has come and past The wickedness can never last Wake me up when corona ends [Verse 4]Bring back the games againLike we did when spring began Wake me up when corona ends [Chorus]Here comes the news again Falling from the skies Washing my hands againBecoming who we are As my memory restsBut forget what is lostWake me up when corona ends [Solo: Guitar][Spoken words]The more you keep it under control. The less you’ll be in risk of running out of that vital equipment that you need. [Verse 5]Winter has come and past The wickedness can never last Wake me up when corona ends [Outro]Like my fater’s come to pastForty years has gone so fast Wake me up when corona ends Wake me up when corona ends Wake me up when corona ends [spoken words]All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
