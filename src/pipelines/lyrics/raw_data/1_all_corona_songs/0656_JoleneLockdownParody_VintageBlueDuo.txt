[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please come take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please come take him right off of my hands

[Verse 1] 
He’s driving me completely spare
Lazing around, just drinking beer
His noisy breathing makes me want to scream
Please come on Jo, don’t be a cow
Come take my man, come take him now
My mental health depends on you, Jolene

[Verse 2]
I’ve been stuck inside with him for weeks
There’s nothing I can do to keep from 
Wondering how quiet it would be
If I dug a hole in my backyard
Just in case this goes to far
Perhaps his life depends on you, Jolene
 
[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please come take this man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please come take him right off of my hands
 
[Verse 3]
And I can easily understand 
That you might go and change your mind
But he’s the only one for you, Jolene
You’ve shopped around, tried many men
And I’m keen to try Tinder again
Yep, he's the only one for you, Jolene
 
[Interlude: Guitar]

[Verse 4]
Well, I had to have this talk with you
His very life depends on you
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene
 
[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please come take this man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please come take him right off of my hands
Oh, please com take him right off of my hands
I'm begging of you, please come take my man
