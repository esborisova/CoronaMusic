[Chorus]
Come little baby, shelter from the storm 
We are going viral, and the fire is warm, 
Keeping calm, carrying on, Scottyâ€™s latest presser is depressing so we are tuning in to This approved message 

[Verse]
From the Senator, bet you are still trying find me
Out of office message, Mahalo from Hawaii 
Leadership is not really something I am feeling kid
You maybe should have voted for the other guy behind me, 

[Verse]
What is the matter little Aussie battler are you tired? 
No - everything I own is on fire
Well your Aussie spirits lifted and you are still kicking on 
Everything is burning better turn the fucking cricket on

[Verse]
We deserve someone who is a little bit better than and no one has been this nice since settlement 
You are not fit to push the whip you back peddaling
You are not fit to wear the kicks that I am treading in 

[Pre-Chorus]
I am smooth, I am real nice like
And it is not like I miss this nightlife
It is all good, yeah it is alright
If I can not start a house party, start a house fire 

[Chorus]
Come little baby, shelter from the storm
We are going viral, and the fire is warm,
We good little citizens sitting in the bunker just 
Watching the boss fumble like my befuddled uncle does 

[Bridge]
We are rocking the lock-in, self-interred
Watching videos of Jacinda Ardern
Shit, even the kiwis are not allowed outside
If I can not start a house party start a house fire

[Verse]
Briggs for PM
Duck Peter Dutton if you see him
Deport this, fuck how you feeling
Pandemic got them reeling people need to see you leading 
Fuck it, football is on, do it after the weekend 
If worst comes to worst the people come first
Yeah but I am going to need the purse for my mega church 
You are not fit we do not get near a penny worth
You are not fit the leadership it is getting plenty worse 
Went to hit the store and everything had been bought they quarantine us all so we are sitting indoors
And if they getting on board I am pulling this rip cord
And ditching this concord and splitting like Jean Claude 

[Pre-Chorus]
I am real nice like
And it is not like I miss this night life, 
Yeah it is alight, if we can not start a house party, start house fire 
Yeah you are alright, but I am kind of sick and tired of being inside
Yeah we are all smiles
If we can not start a house party, start house fire 

[Chorus]
Come little baby, shelter from the storm
We are coughing up lungs and the kettle is on
We already burnt the world outside
If we can not start a house party, start house fire 

[Pre-Chorus] If we can not start a house party, start house fire 
Scotty from marketing standing there shuffling his papers
Wondering why Jesus has not come to save us
Looking to Peter Dutton like, what the fuck is happening? 
At least the Ruby Princess had a fucking captain. 

[Chorus]
Come little baby, shelter from the storm
Stay the fuck inside until the bugger is gone
But we can still stir shit from the inside
If you can not start a house party start a house fire
