[Chorus]
I'm going to wash my hands until I can't no more
I'm going to clean and I'm going to wash some more
I'm going to wash my hands until I can't no more
I'm going to clean and I'm going to wash some more

[Verse 1]
We're going to stay inside 
Stuck in lockdown
Don't want to go nowhere
The virus is around
Netflix and chill, huh
Going to wait it out
Not going to spread the germs
That's what it's about

[Bridge]
We all got to do something 
By doing nothing 
We all got to do something 
Stay home, do nothing 

[Verse 2]
Finding things to do while under lockdown
Still haven't left the house
I don't know when I last took a shower
Watching all the movies
My eyes are glazing over 
FaceTime and zoom all day
How long have I been in front of this screen 

[Bridge]
We all got to do something 
By doing nothing 
We all got to do something 
Stay home, do nothing 

[Chorus]
I'm going to wash my hands until I can't no more
I'm going to clean and I'm going to wash some more
I'm going to wash my hands until I can't no more
I'm going to clean and I'm going to wash some more

[Verse 3]
Sit down, lay down
Living like a bum
Spend way too much money online at Sephora
Now I got a habit spending all day on the internet
But at least I can talk to all my friends 
Got no stress since I can't leave the house
I'm like a house plant lying in the sun
Wish I could leave my house and go on a trip
I want to drive until I can't no more 

[Chorus]
I'm going to wash my hands until I can't no more
I'm going to clean and I'm going to wash some more
I'm going to wash my hands until I can't no more
I'm going to clean and I'm going to wash some more

[Chorus]
I'm going to wash my hands until I can't no more
I'm going to clean and I'm going to wash some more
I'm going to wash my hands until I can't no more
I'm going to clean and I'm going to wash some more
