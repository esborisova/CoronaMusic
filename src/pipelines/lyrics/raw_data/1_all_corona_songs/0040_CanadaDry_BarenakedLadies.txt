[Verse 1]
We were shining like Aurora Borealis
Like Sid sipping from the Stanley chalice
Balling in a bus across the USA
Dumb enough to think that it would stay that way

[Verse 2]
Lounging in the living room in long johns
More distant than Victoria to Saint John's
Trying to use a record to repair my heart
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to start again
My friend

[Chorus]
You're leaving me high and Canada dry
I'm out of your head and I'm losing my mind
Listening to Neil is making me cry
You're leaving me high and Canada dry

[Verse 3]
Sinking like a Saskatoon sunset
Thinking that we had it from the outset
Tommy said that life was a highway, dear
But I became the road kill when you oversteered
Oh why, oh why?

[Chorus]
You're leaving me high and Canada dry
I'm out of your head and I'm losing my mind
Now listening to Joni's making me cry
You're leaving me high and Canada dry
Ba-bada-bah-bah, bah-bah-dah-dah-dah
Ba-bada-bah-bah, bah-bah-dah-dah-dah
Ba-bada-bah-bah, bah-bah-dah-dah-high

[Bridge]
You fled the snow while I stayed here
I'll let you know, I'll make it clear
How happy I appear

[Chorus]
High and Canada Dry
I'm out of your head and I'm losing my mind
Listening to Gordie is making me cry
You're leaving me high
You're leaving me high
You're leaving me high
And Canada dry

[Outro]
Ba-bada-bah-bah, bah-bah-dah-dah-dah
Ba-bada-bah-bah, bah-bah-dah-dah-dah
Ba-bada-bah-bah, bah-bah-dah-dah 
High and Canada dry
