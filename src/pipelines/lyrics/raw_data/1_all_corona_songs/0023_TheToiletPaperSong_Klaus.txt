[Intro: instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When the world is going crazy
And we don't have a clue
Of what is going on
There's still one thing we can do
We buy toilet paper, toilet paper
That is what we do
You can stop the world 
But you'll never stop the poo

[Chorus]
Feels good for me and you
To know we've got it covered
Enough for number two
Until we have recovered

[Verse 2]
If someone needs conviction
Tell them what the heck
This is all we ever need 
Toilet paper, check
Toilet paper, toilet paper 
Never running out
Talk about survival 
We know what it's about

[Chorus]
Feels good for me and you
To know we've got it covered
Enough for number two
Until we have recovered

[Verse 3]
We don't need to mind 
Not worry what to do
As long as we can find
Toilet paper for the loo
Toilet paper, toilet paper 
We bought every bit
We might be out of everything 
But damn it, we can shit

[Chorus]
Feels good for me and you
To know we've got it covered
Enough for number two
Until we have recovered

[Chorus]
Feels good for me and you
To know we've got it covered
Enough for number two
Until we have recovered

[Outro: acoustic guitar]
