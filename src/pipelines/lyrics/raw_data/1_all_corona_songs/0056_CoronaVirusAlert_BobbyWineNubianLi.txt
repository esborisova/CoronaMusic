[Intro: spoken]
The bad news is that everyone is a potential victim 
But the good news is that everyone is a potential solution 
Sensitize the masses to sanitize 
Keep a social distance and quarantine 

[Chorus]
The coronavirus is sweeping over mankind
Everybody must be alert
It's a global pandemic we can never take for granted
Everybody must take charge
The coronavirus disease should not be taken lightly 
Everybody must be alert
It's a matter of life we can never take for granted
Everybody must take charge

[Verse 1]
Discipline and personal hygiene
And make sure you regularly wash your hands 
Keep a distance from everyone 
Report anything like a symptom 
Serious fever is a symptom
Dry cough is a symptom
Even is sneezing a symptom
Itchy eyes and flu is a symptom 

[Verse 2]
If you get sick please do not transmit the disease
Isolate yourself from the public
Be patriotic
See what is happening in Italy
Many people have died 
Prevention is better than a cure

[Chorus]
The coronavirus is sweeping over mankind
Everybody must be alert
It's a global pandemic we can never take for granted
Everybody must take charge
The coronavirus disease should not be taken lightly 
Everybody must be alert
It's a matter of life we can never take for granted
Everybody must take charge
The coronavirus is sweeping over mankind
Everybody must be alert
