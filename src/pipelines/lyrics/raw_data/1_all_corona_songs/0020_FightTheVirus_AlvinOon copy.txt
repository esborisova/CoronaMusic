[Chorus]
Hello virus from Wuhan
Another problem is here again 
Because you see the contagion creeping 
And the virus is indeed spreading 
And the memory of SARS planted in my brain still remains
We stand and fight the virus 

[Verse 1] 
We hear of theories how it grew
From snakes and bats became a flu
Passing the sickness from man to man
Now its growing getting out of hand
It’s a virus that has travelled near and far
Corona
We have to fight the virus

[Verse 2]
And in the latest news I saw 
Ten thousand people maybe more
People falling sick with much coughing 
People falling ill with much sneezing 
People worried for their health and their ones so dear
Pneumonia
We keep the fight, the virus

[Verse 3] 
Keep your hand clean, always know
Hygiene will stop that virus grow
When you sneeze, cover with a tissue
Even coughing, just let me teach you 
Wear a mask if you’re sick so that others won’t get it, too
We count on you 
To help to fight the virus 

[Verse 4]
Together we must overcome
To beat this virus, fight as one
For a life of health and harmony
It’s in our hands, it’s up to you and me
For the health of our land, of our friends and family 
Humanity 
We will win this fight, the virus
