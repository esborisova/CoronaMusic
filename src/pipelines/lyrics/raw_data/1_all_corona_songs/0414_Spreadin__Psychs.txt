Spreading, you can say that it's COVID-19 like the virus 
This year I'm trending, uh
Let me just kill this track 
Spill these facts and I'm on to the next thing 
But let’s take this thing serious
Please stay safe and don't get infected 
Love to the family's who's been affected

Alright, listen

[Verse 1]
Now what will I do when the week ends?
The premier league got called off till next month
No footy on the weekends
Shout-out to all of my ballers who caught that ting
Yeah, it's mad when you deep it
Especially all my gunners 
Big up Arteta, I couldn't believe it

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, 2020 what a start to the year we've had
Some people are saying it's dead 
Some people are saying it ain't that bad
I've got my conspiracies but if I speak I'm in trouble 
The kid isn't trying to get bagged 
But a little flu won’t hurt me either way 
I'm trying run to the bag damn, damn wash your hands

[Bridge]
Don't touch me please
Please don't hug me 
Please don't spud me
Please don't touch me we are not gangsters 
And even if we were, we can make a handshake using our feet
We can make a handshake using elbows, knees 
I'm not trying catch a disease
Dead that, I'm not trying catch no virus

[Verse 3]
Please don't come around me 
Uh, hoodies up on the bus
If I hear someone cough or sneeze
Dead please don't come for me
Sneeze but don't get snot on me
That might lead to quarantine
Bare pages trying plot on me
Bare man trying call shots on me 

[Verse 4]
They say I touch p's with a major 'cause
Not dead I say it's minor 
And Corona it's not a surprise why 
'Cause everything's made in China
And I knew it was coming from time
Barely anything gets by me
Even the Simpson's said this was coming and that was back in 1993

[Breakdown]
Like Rudy Gobert I can't get enough of touching mic's
Now the NBA has been suspended what will I watch on Sunday nights?
But it's not about me (it's not about me)
It's about the people (it's about the people)
Boris is a joke he won’t call off school, the Government's evil
