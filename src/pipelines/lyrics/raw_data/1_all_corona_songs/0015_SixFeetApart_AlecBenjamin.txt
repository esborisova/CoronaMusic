[Verse 1]
They say distance is relative 
and relative to relatives 
I have I'd say I'm relatively close 
To breaking down
Because right now
I feel so alone
I’ve been missing the elements
And wishing the elephant
In the room would leave
And kindly close the door
I can't ignore
Him like before
Not anymore

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you most at 
Six feet apart
When you’re right outside my window
But can’t ride inside my car
And it hurts to know
Just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold
But close enough
To break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

[Bridge]
So far
So far, but so close 
Like a star
Out in the cosmos
Can’t touch
The beauty I see
Thats how it feels at six feet

[Verse 2]
Space and time are interwoven
Well at least that’s what we’re told
When I was young
I was suspicious
But it's true
Time sticks like glue
I feel so blue
Here missing you 
So I think I'll build a time machine 
And go back to a time
When we didn’t need
To measure six feet on the ground
When I came around
That's now allowed
I cant go back now 

[Chorus]
So I miss you most at 
Six feet apart 
When you’re right outside my window 
But can’t ride inside my car 
And it hurts to know 
Just how lovely you are 
And be too far away to hold
But close enough 
To break my heart 
I miss your smile 
Feels like miles 
Six feet apart 

[Bridge]
So far
So far, but so close
Like a star
Out in the cosmos
Can’t touch
The beauty I see 
That's how it all feels to me 
So far
So far but so close
Like a star
Out in the cosmos
Can’t touch
The beauty I see
That's how
It feels at six feet
