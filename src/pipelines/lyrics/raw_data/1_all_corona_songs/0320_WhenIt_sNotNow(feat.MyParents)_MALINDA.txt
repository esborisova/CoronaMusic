[Verse 1]I'll tip my waiter a little bit extraHold on to stillness every now and thenI'll be there to seemy best friend get marriedMarvel at Paris from a boat out on the SeineWho knows when[Chorus]But for now we distance in days of fourteen While the braver ones battle the monster unseenA nation offers applause but it's never enoughSomehowBut someday we'll seeThat good news won't be an exception to the ruleWhen it's not nowSomeday[Verse 2]We'll stop by our favorite restaurantAdmire a painting down at the MetWe'll go to a play, then a festivalBathe in the color of a summer sunsetAnd we won't forget[Chorus]That we once measured our days in fourteenWhile the braver ones battled the monster unseenA nation offered applause but it wasn't enoughSomehowBut someday we'll seeThat good news won't be an exception to the ruleWhen it's not nowSomeday[Verse 3]Will what divided us seem simple?Will all of my friends be here in the end?Will the world be somehow reimagined?Will I be scared to hug my mother when I see her again?Who knows when[Chorus]But for now we distance in days of fourteenWhile the braver ones battle the monster unseenStatues and tributes could never be enoughSomehowBut someday we'll seeThat good news won't be an exception to the ruleWhen it's not now
