[Chorus]
Quarantine, gotta quarantine
Quarantine, gotta quarantine
Sanitize, I must sanitize
Vaccine, need a vaccine
Mask on, keep my mask on 
Mask on, keep my mask on
Sanitize, I must sanitize
Quarantine, gotta quarantine

[Verse 1]
Lockdown, I gonna go insane
School's moved to a whole another domain
Feeling symptoms, might be positive
They disinfecting, I don't know if I'm gonna live
Stuck at home, really miss the crew
Overthinking, is it just the flu?
High fever, I can barely move
Can't breathe, I hope that I improve
Real pain, I'm in real pain
Coronavirus, I wanna complain
Going out, that's a liability
I'll stay at home, but do you have TP?

[Chorus]
Quarantine, gotta quarantine
Quarantine, gotta quarantine
Sanitize, I must sanitize
Vaccine, need a vaccine
Mask on, keep my mask on 
Mask on, keep my mask on
Sanitize, I must sanitize
Quarantine, gotta quarantine
