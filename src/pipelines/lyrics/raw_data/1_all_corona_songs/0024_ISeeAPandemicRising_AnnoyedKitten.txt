[Verse 1]
I feel a pandemic rising 
Is it hysteria or the flu?  
Stay home, is what they're advising 
Staying home when sick should not be new 

[Chorus]
Wash your hands tonight 
And you will be alright 
When corona's on the rise  

[Verse 2]
People are hoarding toilet paper
Pasta is nowhere to be found 
Instead of just stop to use their vapers
Panic is spread all over town 

[Chorus]
Wash your hands tonight 
And you will be alright 
When corona's on the rise 

[Interlude: instrumental]

[Verse 3] 
Hope people get a grip together
Hope they calm down and do it quick 
Don't make a hen out of a feather
Just stay fucking home if you are sick

[Chorus]
Wash your hands tonight 
And you will be alright 
When corona's on the rise  

[Outro]
Wash your hands tonight 
And you will be alright 
When corona's on the rise
