Life can be tough for a virus, this town can get you down 
But I have got a lot inside to give and quickly spread around 
Everyone wants me to disappear so quickly go away
But no vaccine can ever cure my dreams to be on broadway
So many people have left already, why oh why cannot I breakout of this podunk town and have an outbreak in the sky

(Spoken text) 

Wow here I am on broadway, rubbing elbows with the stars
Let me prove that I can be a bigger deal that sars

Oh yeah coronavirus in the building aka Covid 19 aka your pandemic, masks up, let us get it
Going to get famous, my reach is outrageous, the triple threat king, I rap and I sing and I am highly contagious 
I am coast to coast, I am already global
You on my crown have been trying to tell fuck you up like Chernobyl
Yes I am taking over, that is what I told you, yes I am inside your girl allover the world, my name is corona

(Spoken text)

I think back to that provincial Chinese provence, I will remember my roots, I promised when I was discovered and told my mother, it was either a Bat or something called a Pangolin, that I spread my wings and fly.
