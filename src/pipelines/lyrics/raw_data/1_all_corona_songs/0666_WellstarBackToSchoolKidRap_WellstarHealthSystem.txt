[Chorus]
Wash your hands, wipe your desk
Keep a schedule, and do your best
My space, your space, mask on my face
It’s what we do to keep everyone safe
Cough in your elbow and sneeze there too
Achoo
Don’t touch your face, because we care about you

[Verse 1]
You need to stay at home if you don’t feel good
Make sure you see your doctor when you know you should
Wellstar get you ready for school
At home or in person, stay safe and be cool
Sing

[Chorus]
Wash your hands, wipe your desk
Keep a schedule, and do your best
My space, your space, mask on my face
It’s what we do to keep everyone safe
Cough in your elbow and sneeze there too
Achoo
Don’t touch your face, because we care about you

[Verse 2]
At school or at home, please sanitize
Don’t forget to keep it clean and use your wipes
If school is online then stay on track
And remember to sing this back-to-school Wellstar rap
Sing

[Chorus]
Wash your hands, wipe your desk
Keep a schedule, and do your best
My space, your space, mask on my face
It’s what we do to keep everyone safe
Cough in your elbow and sneeze there too
Achoo
Don’t touch your face, because we care about you

[Verse 3]
If school is online then stay on track
And remember to sing this back-to-school Wellstar rap
Wellstar
