[Verse 1]Wash your hands, every now and then I get a little bit lonely ‘cause I never go outdoors Wash your hands, every now and then I get a little bit tired Of listening to the sound of television Wash your hands, every now and then I get a little bit nervous about my sanitizer supply Wash your hands, every now and then I get a little bit terrified you’re on my thirty-six by square feetWash your hands twenty seconds Now and then I hear my neighbors talk Wash your hands twenty seconds I’ll greet you from my trunk in the park [Verse 1]Every now and then I get a little bit reckless and I homeschool a child Wash your hands, every now and then I get a little bit helpless and take the scissors to my own hair Wash your hands, every now and then I get a little bit angry when I see corona-spiracy theories Wash your hands, every now and then I get a little bit terrified my food delivery’s too busy Wash your hands twenty seconds Now and then I hear my neighbors talk Wash your hands twenty seconds I’ll greet you from my trunk in the park [Chorus]And I need toilet paper tonight And I need it more than ever And if I can only glove up tonight Maybe I could touch my salad I’ll only read one news article tonight ‘Cause if I read more I might Together but apart, only chatting online Corona like a cloud prying all of the time First one we’ve been too, wish I knew what to do I’m watching the apocalypse from my laptop I need some happy tonightMy anxiety’s keeping me up all night My anxiety’s keeping me up all night [Verse 3]Once upon a time I could sneeze without far But now they’re bringing pitchforks and spires Numbers climbing high a total eclipse of the charts Once upon a time I was worried about time But now there’s only the doomsday clock Numbers climbing high a total eclipse of the charts [Spoken words]If I have to spend even one more minute with you, I’m filing for a divorce [Interlude][Chorus]Stay indoors government orders Every now and then I change my partStay indoors government orders I’ll greet you from my trunk in the park And I need you indoors tonight And I need you isolated forever And if you still go out tonightWe’ll be in quarantine forever And we all will be making it right If we stay away for each other Together but apart, only chatting online Corona like a cloud prying all of the time First one we’ve been too, whish I knew what to do I’m watching the apocalypse from my laptop And now we’re up all night The sun is coming out tonight Why is the sun out at night [Verse 4]Once upon a time I was in the day But now I’m only up when it’s dark Nothing I can do a total eclipse of the charts Once upon a time I was in the day But now I’m only up when it’s dark Nothing I can do a total eclipse of the charts A total eclipse of the charts
