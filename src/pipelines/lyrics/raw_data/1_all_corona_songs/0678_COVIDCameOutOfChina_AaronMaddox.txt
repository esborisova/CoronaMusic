[Intro: Fiddle]

[Verse 1: Spoken word]
COVID came out of China, it was looking for a lung to steal
It was so unkind, it wanted your behind, it didn’t care how it made you feel
When it came across this large group, they were talking and breathing a lot
It jumped right down into their lungs and said: “nNw look what you’ve got” 

[Verse 2: Spoken word]
“I know you may no know it yet, but I’ve infected you
Now go out with your friends and give it to all of those folks, too
Now you look pretty healthy, son, but give this COVID its due
I know you’ve been told I can take your soul, ‘cause I’m worse than any flu”
The lung said, “I feel puny I wanna feel good again
I’m gonna fight this with all my might so let this fight begin”

[Chorus]
Tell that lung to rest up while you fight that battle hard
You wanna beat the COVID, so your lungs don’t get to scarred
And if you win, you get to go on with your life, I’m told
but if you lose, it might be ‘cause you’re old

[Solo: Fiddle]

[Verse 3: Spoken word]
The COVID took a big, deep breath and he said “I’ll start this show”
And pain came into these lungs and made it hard to blow
And it caused a fever and other symptoms the body couldn’t miss
The COVID settled in those lunges and it sounded something like this

[Verse 4: Spoken word] 
When COVID finished, the body said, “well you’re pretty good, old son
but hold on to your virus boots, and let me show you how it’s done”

[Bridge]
Fire in the lungs, immunity run
We’re gonna fight this, it won’t be fun
COVID trying to make it hard to blow
We’re gonna fight and make this virus go

[Solo: Fiddle]

[Verse 5: Spoken word]
COVID bowed its head, because it knew that it’d been beat
and it left that body completely from its head down to its feet
Body said “COVID, just come on back if you ever want to try again
I’ve got antibodies now, so that’s the last that you get in”

[Bridge]
Fire in the lungs, immunity run
We’re gonna fight this, it won’t be fun
COVID trying to make it hard to blow
We’re gonna fight and make this virus go
