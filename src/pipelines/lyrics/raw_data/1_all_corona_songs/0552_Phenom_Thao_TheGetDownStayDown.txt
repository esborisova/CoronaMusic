[Verse 1]
Sip on joy the purest drink
Move to make 
Thought to think
They can feel us from afar
Avenues and boulevards 

[Chorus 1]
White collar cannibal 
What you gonna do
Everyone's a tendon
So who you gonna chew 
I will not equivocate
If that's so, let's celebrate

[Verse 2]
Shamefully shame's claim on me
Led my life with infamy
But I don't call it
I don't solve it
I dissolve it
Famously 

[Chorus 2]
I've been so politely at the bottom 
Pull it tight boot strap
Strap it on and top them
I've been so politely at the bottom 
Pull it tight boot strap
Strap it on and top them

[Verse 3]
In the past
I was patient
Now I'm so tired
Fa-fa-fa feverish few, I will not drop it
Power cowards never stop it
I have nurtured 
You corrupted 
I am erupting
Don't interrupt it

[Chorus 3]
Careful I'm an animal, trap, trap, trap
First of the secondary class, class, class
You know I don't trust you what's the catch, catch, catch
Don't you fucking touch me I will gnash, gnash, gash

[Bridge 1]
Cause I am an old phenomenon
And I am an old phenomenon

[Bridge 2]
Show them we believe
See the unforeseen
Sharpen canine teeth
Get those ringside seats
When the scorched of the earth 
Come back by sea

[Verse 1]
Sip on joy the purest drink
Move to make 
Thought to think
They can feel us from afar
Avenues and boulevards 

[Chorus 2]
I've been so politely at the bottom 
Pull it tight boot strap
Strap it on and top them 
I've been so politely at the bottom 
Pull it tight boot strap
Strap it on and top them 

[Outro 1]
I've been so politely at the
I've been so politely at the
I've been so politely at the
I've been so politely at the

[Outro 2]
In the past 
I was peaceful
Now I'm on fire
I'm a creature 
I'm a feature
Of the future
And I am on fire

[Bridge 1]
But I am an old phenomenon
But I am an old phenomenon
But I am an old phenomenon
But I am an old phenomenon
