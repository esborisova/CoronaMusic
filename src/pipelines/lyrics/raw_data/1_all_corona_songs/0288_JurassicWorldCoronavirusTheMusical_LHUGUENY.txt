[Verse 1] After the Lockwood fiasco, the dinosaurs are freeRoaming the States on an eating spreeTrying to munch people at camping groundsScaring folks to death in cities and townsAs if things weren’t bad enoughA deadly virus hit the world, now that is roughYou can’t teach dinosaurs social distance rulesWe’ll have to catch & quarantine them with tranquilizer toolsBased on our tests there’s something interesting I’ve seenDinosaurs are immune to Covid-19In dinosaur DNA lies the key to a vaccineThen mix the two to start a new hybrid schemeThough Indominus and Indoraptor miserably failedI think a dinosaur-virus mixture would surely prevailThe way to earn more profits when selling a vaccineIs setting free a beast that’s contagious and mean[Pre-chorus]Here we go againThey take my DNATo make a monster So mean and stronger[Chorus]Half dinosaur, half virusBred to wipe out any populaceStomp victims with my feetOr introduce them to my teethThin out the herd with CovidEat all asymptomaticI am a menaceHalf dinosaur, half virusCo-corona, Co-co-corona, Co-corona, Coronasaurus-RexCo-corona, Co-co-corona, Co-corona, Coronasaurus-Rex[Verse 2]Blue and Rexy must be freedAnd don’t forget steal Dr Wu’s vaccineMass-produce enough to heal mankindSo we can finally leave this disaster behindUhm but as long as that hybrid’s freeThe virus won’t cease its deadly spreeMutations can’t be stopped by a single injectionWe need help to stop that beast from spreading infections Staying still won’t save you from being lunchBut running can’t save you from its viral punchMasks don’t provide a sure-fire protectionOnly hazmat suits can prevent Covid infectionsNow that we’re sure that we can’t get sick and dieOur dinosaur friends belt out their battle criesThey’re immune to the illness, our best shotTo halt Coronasaurus-Rex, make sure the chaos stops[Pre-chorus]This better be the last timeFighting hybrids, I’m drawing the lineNext time you monkeys screw upI’ll pack my bags, leave you all to die[Chorus]Half dinosaur, half virusBred to wipe out any populaceStomp victims with my feetOr introduce them to my teethThin out the herd with CovidEat all asymptomatic I am a menaceHalf dinosaur, half virus[Bridge]All this hybrid fighting’s too much for meYou’d better pay for my holiday First class, all expenses paidIf you expect me to brawl, make this hybrid payWhere’s my stimulus check? I ain’t seen a dimeLeavin dinosaurs to starve should be a crimeDon’t judge me for hunting humans for food I’ll kill Coronasaurus for me, not youCo-corona, Co-co-corona, Co-corona, Coronasaurus-RexCo-corona, Co-co-corona, Co-corona, Coronasaurus-Rex
