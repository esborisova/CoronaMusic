[Verse 1]
Heard a message in my car on the radio station
Says a virus going to get everyone in the nation
Got on my phone just to verify the situation
Seems like it’s affecting everyone in creation

[Verse 2]
Stopped by Trader Joe’s to pick up some pasta
Inside everybody looks a little bit hostile
Shelves are empty and nobody’s acting like a good neighbor
Why’s everybody gotta have so much toilet paper

[Chorus]
C O V I D nineteen 
Coronavirus is a bugging me
I need my friends and my family
To be close to me 
Close to me 

[Verse 3]
Can’t go to work can’t go to school
Can’t go to church cause that’s the rule
I feel like I’m on house arrest
And it’s putting my patience to the test

[Verse 4]
All those numbers and data too
I Can’t believe everything that I read in the news
There’s got to be a way to have some fun
Got to get back with the people I love

[Chorus]
C O V I D nineteen 
Coronavirus is a bugging me
I need my friends and my family
To be close to me 
Close to me 

[Chorus]
C O V I D nineteen 
Coronavirus is a bugging me
I need my friends and my family
To be close to me 
Close to me 

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
If you don’t know how to spend your time 
Take my advice let it ease your mind
Don’t be afraid of what you see online
No worries cause you’re going to be just fine

[Guitar riff]

[Chorus]
C O V I D nineteen 
Coronavirus is a bugging me
I need my friends and my family
To be close to me 
Close to me

[Chorus]
C O V I D nineteen 
Coronavirus is a bugging me
I need my friends and my family
To be close to me 
Close to me
