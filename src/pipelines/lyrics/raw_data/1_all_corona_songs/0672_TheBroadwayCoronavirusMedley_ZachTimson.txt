[Verse 1]
Wash your hands, wash your hands
And please cancel all your plans
If you’re going to the store, be sure
You’re buying food in cans
Use Purell, and use soap
Which you already do, I hope
And be sure to social distance
At six feet, don’t have resistance
Stay indoors, stay inside
From the universe, you’ll hide
If you’re an introvert, I bet you understand
Just please try not to panic
And don’t be satanic
Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands

[Verse 2]
Scrub your nails, get the cracks
Act the way your mother acts
Wash your hands for 20 seconds
It’s so easy, no directions
Don’t wear masks, they don’t work
And plus you look like a jerk
You might think you’ll help a billion
But you scare the little children
Yes, we know, it sounds dumb
“When will real precautions come?”
But please do what WHO commands
It’s really super easy
so to not feel queasy 
Wash your hands, wash your hands
Or you’ll end up in wristbands
Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands

[Spoken word]
You know what sucks about this Coronavirus is that everything is closing
Like last week every business was saying

[Verse 3]
We’re closing for the virus
It’s better safe than sorry
We ought to be more careful
Just like Aziz Ansari
We think it’s only temporary 
We will be okay
So we’re closing for the virus today

[Spoken word]
And then the governor of California said we all have to stay inside ‘till April 19th, Shit

[Verse 4]
We’re closing for the virus
It’s worse than we suspected
We haven’t been this panicked
Since Donald got elected
So just for now we’re gonna
Keep our eyes on CNN
And in April we’ll be open again

[Spoken word]
I mean we have to, things are going to get better, right?

[Verse 5]
We’re closing for the virus
It really isn’t funny
A month without a profit
Means we’re losing tons of money
We thought it would be over
But then came the NBA
Then MLB was feeling blue
Then Disneyland was closing too
Coachella said, “what will we do?”
Spring breaks are on week number two
The Boston marathon is through
But when it got Tom Hanks, we knew
We’re closing for the virus today

[Spoken word] 
There is one thing you can do

[Verse 6]
Please stay home
Your colleges are closing
Work online and stay in your pajamas
And if your, your major is performing
Just sing inside your bedroom
’till the temperatures are warming
Stay inside, don’t leave your house ‘till April
Don’t get sick and keep your pets at distance
Sorry Callie
And if you, you feel a cough start fussing
Please cough into your elbow, not your hand
‘Cause that’s disgusting

[Verse 7]
TP
Everyone’s buying TP
We’re alone with the VP
Who thinks science is fake

[Verse 8]
Oh Corona, you’re a bitch
And you destroyed our year
Now we can’t go roam
We must stay home
And watch the whole first season of “Cheer”
Oh Corona, you are such a bad attention whore
Oh Corona, you’re like “look at me, I’m on TV”
While the nation’s puking on the floor
You want us to stay quarantined
Until we get a freaking vaccine
And when we scream *beep* oh we’re all gonna die”
We’re only saying “we hate your guts”
Oh Corona
Oh Corona
God, why?
C O R O N A 
Oh Corona
