[Chorus]
We are strong together
We fight together
Defeat corona 
To the end 
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
We are one, but different nations 
Coming together, no separation 
Show love to face situation now

[Undetected language]
We only have each other

[Pre-chorus]
Corona is the foe
You and I are bros
No discrimination, I'm not virus
Wash your hands and be precautious 
When you are out there
Corona is the foe
You and I are bros
No discrimination, I'm not virus
Wash your hands and be precautious 

[Chorus]
We are strong together
We fight together
Defeat corona 
To the end 
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
We are strong together
We fight together
Defeat corona 
To the end 
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
[Undetected language]

[Verse 3]
Together we conquer, we prosper we make it to the top
Nobody can stop us 
Because China is my second home
Corona is liar
People no they tire
Everyday they say this they, say that
Causing panicking
People are vanishing 
Never spread rumors, just to make yourself famous 
Wear your mask
Wash your hands 
This thing shall be over 
Very soon I tell you
