[Verse 1]Early in the evening just about supper timeOver by the courthouse they're starting to unwindFour kids on the corner trying to bring you upWilly picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp[Chorus]Down on the cornerOut in the streetWilly and the Poor Boys are playingBring a nickel, tap your feet[Verse 2]Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smileBlinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a whilePoor Boy twangs the rhythm out on his KalamazooAnd Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo[Chorus]Down on the cornerOut in the streetWilly and the Poor Boys are playingBring a nickel, tap your feet[Interlude] [Chorus]Down on the cornerOut in the streetWilly and the Poor Boys are playingBring a nickel, tap your feet[Verse 3]You don't need a penny just to hang aroundBut if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?Over on the corner there's a happy noisePeople come from all around to watch the magic boy[Chorus]Down on the cornerOut in the streetWilly and the Poor Boys are playingBring a nickel, tap your feetDown on the cornerOut in the streetWilly and the Poor Boys are playingBring a nickel, tap your feet
