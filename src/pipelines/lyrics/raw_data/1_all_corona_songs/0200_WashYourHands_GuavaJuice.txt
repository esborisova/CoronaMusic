[Intro spoken]
Did you wash your hands? (yup)
Did you wash your hands? (yeah)
Did, did, did you wash your hands? (yup) 
Did ya’? 

[Chorus]
Washing my hands like all day (all day)
Not touching my face all day (all day)
I’m just gonna stay home all day (all day)
I’m bored in the house but I’m okay (okay)
‘cause I got you (aye)
‘cause I got you (aye)
‘cause I got you (aye)
I’m bored in the house but I’m okay (all day) 

[Vers 1] 
Aye, it’s corona time 
I’m a influencer 
But I don’t got influenza 
But I’m ‘bout to influence ya’ 
With this sick flow, so ill 
But you know the beat is sicker 
This pandemic, we can end it 

Doing your part to help prevent
Covid-19 we are a team 
Washing your hands 20 seconds 
Front and the back, nooks and the crans 
Steppin’ way back, six feet or more 
Social distance 
Achoo, bless you
Did you use a tissue?

[Interlude spoken]
Remember to wash your hands 
1 hand, 2 hands, 3 hands 
20 seconds, just wash your hands 
Kill all those germs, okay?

[Chorus]
Washing my hands like all day (all day)
Not touching my face all day (all day) 
I’m just gonna stay home all day (all day) 
I’m bored in the house but I’m okay (okay)
‘cause I got you (aye) 
‘cause I got you (aye)
‘cause I got you (aye) 
I’m bored in the house but I’m okay (all day) 

[Vers 2]
Your hands have some germs 
They weren’t there before 
By washing your hands 
You are saving the world 
You’re helping a friend 
Don’t you break down inside 
We’re all on your side 
Germs got nowhere to hide 

You think you got me, but you don’t 
I know your weakness and it’s soap 
You can’t defeat me, oh you won’t 
You think you got me, haha nope

[Interlude spoken] 
Did you wash your hands yet, probably not 
After this song I want you to wash your hands with soap 
For 20 seconds, you got it, good

[Chorus] 
Washing my hands like all day (all day) 
Not touching my face all day (all day) 
I’m just gonna stay home all day (all day) 
I’m bored i the house but I’m okay (okay)
‘cause I got you (aye)
‘cause I got you (aye) 
‘cause I got you (aye) 
I’m bored in the house but I’m okay 

[Outro spoken]
This has been a public announcement 
To wash your hands, please
