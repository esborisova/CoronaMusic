[Verse 1]
This craziness all started out on Spring break
The kids were all at home and everything was great
They're tired in their eyes had them in the bed by eight
And sleeping, just sleeping
They had their fun but it was time to go back
No more lounging around and no more endless snacks
But then we found out this virus might attack
Now I teach them, ‘cause they’re not going back

[Chorus]
Yeah, teach it, teach it
Find a lesson plan and teach it
Oh, now let’s watch it on YouTube, search it on Google
It doesn’t matter, just let the kids Doodle
And teach it, teach it
Just teach it, teach it

[Verse 2]
I have to show them that I’m really not scared
I know a lot of stuff but I feel unprepared
I can barely get them dressed, but I guess I’ll do my best
And teach them, just teach them
Now the museum and the zoo are both closed
There’s an endless stream of questions I don’t really know
But if we want to stay alive, I guess I’ll keep the kids inside
And teach them, ‘cause now we’re doing homeschool

[Chorus]
Yeah, teach it, teach it
Look it up online, repeat it
Oh, now let’s watch it on YouTube, search it on Google
Print something out, make art from old noodles
And teach it, teach it
Pinterest has cool ideas, yeah
Now we’ re learning with Lego, class is in session
Everything here is now a life lesson
Let’s teach it, teach it, teach it
Let's teach it, teach it, teach it

[Chorus]
Yeah, teach it, teach it
The house is a disaster, clean it!
Oh, had something on Netflix, now they want Hulu
Just give me one second, I’m trying to watch the news 
Yeah, teach it, teach it
Just get yourself a book and read it
Oh yeah, can’t help with math, we’ll do that stuff later
For bathroom breaks ask, conserve toilet paper
Yeah, teach it, teach it
Yeah, teach it
