[Verse 1]
It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas
But just the parts that blow
There's a line to get in the store
You're eating a whole lot more
And you're in pajamas now instead of clothes
It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas
Though it's not yet June
And you're second-guessing your life
And you're fighting with your wife
And you're drunk by noon

[Verse 2]
It's the most horrible week of the year
There were more stock market crashes
And schools say that classes are iffy next year
It's the most horrible week of the year
Oh, there's a hurricane growing in Florida
Oh, and Vermont got 9 inches of snow
And a giant rocket almost crashed into Central Park
Literally three days ago

[Verse 3]
Kevin, the mailman is the only man I see
When he drives by, I yell "Kevin, hi"
Can you come here and talk to me
But Kevin the mailman didn't stop, he drove away
As he waved goodbye, I kind of wanted to cry
'Cause I'm really lonely 

[Spoken word]
Oh this will cheer me up, talking about what we want
What do you want?
Do you know what you want?
I'll tell you what I want

[Verse 4]
I don't want a lot for August
I know that it's three months from now
But the only thing I want
To get the kids out of my house
They can't take much more of Zoom
They need actual classrooms
Make my wish come true
All I want for August is school
Yeah, school baby

[Bridge]
I know that school is tough with children everywhere
But I just need a way to get them out my hair
I'm pretty sure they play video games six hours a day
But I don't have no time to check because
We're both busy as heck

[Verse 5]
Should 2020 be forgot
That would be totally fine
'Cause 2020 can eat my farts
And I have no concept of time
