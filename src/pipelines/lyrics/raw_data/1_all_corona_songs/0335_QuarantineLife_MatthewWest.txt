[Verse 1]I wish that I could go to Target It’s been a few weeks I’d spend a couple hours shopping Buy something I don’t need Last night I dreamed I went to Starbucks I heard them say welcome back Then I woke up and drank a bad cup of coffee Through a homemade mask, and now I’m sad[Chorus]Quarantine life Quarantine life Can’t lose weight, but I’m losing my mind Quarantine life Quarantine life Killing that corona with a Clorox wipe It’s lonely inside But we’re gonna survive This quarantine life Quarantine life It ain’t good, but it’s all right [Verse 2]I think I might have had a birthday But I don’t know what month it is And on the days I take a shower, yeah I Consider that a win Every day my girl’s complaining ‘Cause they closed the salon Now she’s looking like a stranger to me Always thought she was a blonde, but she not [Chorus]Quarantine life Quarantine life Shopping onlineQuarantine life Quarantine life Make the Tiger King famous overnight It’s lonely inside But we’re gonna survive This quarantine life Quarantine life It ain’t good, but it’s all right [Verse 3]I wanna leave my house I wanna touch my face I wanna hug my friends I never thought I’d say I wanna go to work I wanna wear some pants Kids to go to school I love them but, oh man I wanna play a showDoing what I loveI wanna go to church Cracker barrel brunch I wanna leave my house I wanna touche my face Oh, it’s just another day [Chorus]In this quarantine life Quarantine life Quarantine life Quarantine life Friday night toilet paper shopping online It’s lonely inside But we gonna survive This quarantine life Quarantine life It ain’t good, but it’s all right Quarantine life Quarantine life It ain’t good, but it’s all right Quarantine life Quarantine life
