Coronavirus is coming 
Where is your face mask
If your window is open
Close it 

Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming
Where is your face mask, face mask, face mask, face mask

[Intro]
Attention
What is up, what what is going on
Grab your face mask right now 
Why bro, why
Ay yo, shut up and grab your face mask right now

[Chorus]
Coronavirus is coming, it's coming 
Coronavirus is coming, it's here
Coronavirus is coming, it's coming
Where's your face mask, grab it

Coronavirus is coming, it's coming 
Coronavirus is coming, grab it 
Where's your face mask, grab it, grab it 

[Verse 1]
If your window's open, I'm going to need you to close it 
I need you to hide your face
It is creeping in your place
Hey, hey ,hey ,hey give me space, space, space
For the hand sanitizer, I might do the race
Zoom

[Verse 2]
Hey do you wash your hands? Do you wash your hands?
Do you wash your hands? Do you wash your hands?
Seen a clean lady, I might go throw some pants, go throw some ones 
Do you wash your hands? Do you?
Do you wash your hands? Do you?
If you kick on the beat it just might make you dance 

[Chorus]
Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming, it's coming 
Coronavirus is coming, it's here 
Where's your face mask 

[Chorus]
Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming
Where's your face mask

C O R O N A corona
You see someone coughing you must run away, please go away
Please be respectful, wish them a good day, thank you sir
Corona is bad, yeah, it is a disgrace, Hey
First you grab your towel and you jump in the shower
If you was coughing stay in for an hour 
I'll call the cops if you think you can touch me 
Stay ten feet away or it's going to get ugly
I'll beat you

[Chorus]
Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming
Where's your face mask 

[Chorus]
Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming
Coronavirus is coming
Where's your face mask
