[Verse 1]
Corona, corona, why don't you let me be?
Corona, corona, you make me cough and sneeze
You really got me going
You knocked me to my knees

[Verse 2]
Corona, corona, it's an emergency
Corona, corona, let's call the CDC 
And if that don't do it
Give me some CBD

[Verse 3]
Corona, corona, you're always in the news
Corona, corona, can't even take a cruise
Squeezing my Charmin
Just to sing in the blues

[Verse 4]
Corona, corona, somebody sneezed on me
Achoo
Corona, corona, need to buy more TP
Don't even shake my hand
You stay away from me

[Verse 5]
Corona, corona, we just don't want you here
Corona, corona, and all your fears
You're just a bad old virus
And not a Mexican beer 

[Yodelling]
