[Verse 1]
At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
The need to poo was brewing from deep inside
But there is no toilet roll not a single tiny bit 
And now the cat is looking like a perfect fit

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I had to wipe, and that was that
Have you ever searched in Google remove human feces from a cat
I should have used another tool, maybe wiped it on the grass
'Cause now I’ve got a bloody hair ball stuck up in my ass  

[Chorus]
Oh please don’t go and panic buy
Just turn around now, it's easy if you try
I went down to the shop just to get a single roll
Just to spare my pet cat Mittens from cleaning my bum hole        
But, I’ll take five, I will survive,
As long as I self-isolate, I know I’ll stay alive
I would sell my little soul, for a pack of toilet roll
But I’ll survive, I will survive

[Verse 3]
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
When I saw the mass of people gathered in the park 
What these twats don’t understand is that distance saves a life 
If you think this is two meters, then I feel sorry for your wife

[Verse 4]
Understand, and wash your hands
We need to help the NHS with a social ban
and as for all you panic buyers that just haven't got a clue
I'm coming round to your front door step, the next time I need a poo

[Chorus]
Oh please don’t go and panic buy
Just turn around now, it's easy if you try,
There will always be some idiots that will never understand
But we won't crumble, if we just stick to the plan 
But, I’ll take five, I will survive,
As long as I self-isolate, I know I’ll stay alive.
and if you sell this on Ebay, I'll get on my knees and pray
You won't survive, you won't survive, hey hey
