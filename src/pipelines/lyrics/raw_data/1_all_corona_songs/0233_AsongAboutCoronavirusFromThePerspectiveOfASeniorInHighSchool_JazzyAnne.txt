[Verse 1]I’m kind of sick of sitting here I wanna go and face my fears This time we have is limitedCause it’s my senior year [Verse 2]I’m sure you’ve heard us all complain I’m not trying to come off vain We just wanted these last few months To go on, no more pain [Chorus]Who knows if we’ll have a last day I’m trying to stay positive, but not in the corona way I just want to freaking graduate 	So please excuse me if I want to go to class Corona you’re an ass [Verse 3]Who thought that’d 18 years go by And it’s like we didn’t even try School is all we knowAnd now we’re left with a bunch of extra time[Verse 4]It’s weird to make time for myself Get sleep and take care of my health I’m thankful for our classroom calls What a way to say farewell [Bridge]And I’m just trying figure this out How so much changed so fast Is the world on timeout? I wasn’t prepared to say goodbye to the last year of teen age This all just feels so strange Will I walk across a stage? [Verse 5]I know I need to do my part Stay inside, the world is torn apart That matters more than a little year Even though it breaks my heart [Verse 6]I miss my friends, I miss the sun And damn I just miss having fun But let’s hope and pray, if we all do well This whole thing will be undone
