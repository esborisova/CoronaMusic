[Chorus]I remember love in the cityLiving for the late-night lifeHow we had a good time baby, burning all our moneySleeping with the daylight [Verse 1]I used to be the king of sunshineAnd I had no troubles on my mind Realizing now for the first timeThat I’m counting the cost for the way that it wasIt’s a hell of a price to pay[Chorus]What happened to the golden daysNow all I got is rain and clouds in my wayI need some of that you and me like it used to beBring back those golden daysYeah [Verse 2]I remember love in the cityThere was music playing night after nightAnd I thought this dream would last for eternityBut there’s no turning back from this place that we’re atBut I still got the memory[Chorus]So what happened to the golden daysNow all I got is rain and clouds in my wayI need some of that you and me like it used to beBaby bring back those golden daysYeah, yeah [Solo: Guitar][Verse 3]I remember love in the city Living for the late-night lifeHow we had a good time babyBut we’re counting the cost for the way that it wasSay goodbye to the golden daysYeah, yeah, oh no no[Outro: Instrumental]La la la la la La la la….Yeah
