[Intro]I see you running your mouth, but I don’t see you washing your hands But I don’t see you washing your hands You’d better recognize, this is real COVID-19[Verse 1]Short of breath or got a cough Step back or I’m knocking off your block Wash your hands, don’t touch your face Infect me and I’ll put you in your place[Verse 2]Buy all the toilet roll Hand sanitizer filled with alcohol But I’m straight edge ‘cause that’s just how I roll Get it in your hands and rub them nice and tight Clean fists and the pit, about to fight If you haven’t got none use hot water and soap Wash for thirty seconds so your hands are feeling dope Take this information and stick it in your head ‘cause if you don’t your nan could end up dead [Hook]Now I ain’t scaremongering But get ready for the (out)breakdown Self-isolate Crowd kill corona Spin kick it in the face Crowd kill corona Put that pussy in its place Crowd kill corona Break its jaw with one swift kick Crowd kill corona Get back to being a beer, you little prick
