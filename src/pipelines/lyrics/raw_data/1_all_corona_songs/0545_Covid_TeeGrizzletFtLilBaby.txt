[Chorus]
Whole world on lockdown, shit like a movie (it's crazy)
Do I prefer this over jail? Nigger, absolutely (hell yeah)
I've been quarantining, playing Call of Duty
I've been getting pussy, playing Call of Duty

[Verse 1]
My nigger Block just bought a rolly, he can't even go nowhere (he stuck)
Humidifiers going, you know that shit in the air (ooh!)
I don't know whose city worse right now, but say your prayers (amen)
Seven hundred people died in one day, man, say a prayer (amen)
They say the heat kill it, how the fuck they know? (how the fuck they know?)
What about the places that's always cold? (Alaska)
They giving checks to people that can't work and stay at home (huh?)
What about the artists that can't do shows? (I need it)

[Chorus]
'Cause the whole world on lockdown, shit like a movie (it's crazy)
Do I prefer this over jail? Nigger, absolutely (fuck yeah)
I've been quarantining, playing Call of Duty (Call of Duty
I've been getting pussy, playing Call of Duty (Call of Duty)

[Verse 2]
Baby, sell a hundred bags, sell a hundred bags (hundred bags)
Another hundred bags, another hundred bags (hundred bags)
Three thousand a bag, this one-point-two (cash)
I can play the side and be the coach or be the point too
I'm all about scoring
Chilling with my kids, I ain't even thought about touring
I'm making my business outweigh my performance
Every day we lit, lit, it never gets boring
How you go from stolen cars to hopping out a foreign? 
Off-White Jordans just to go recording
Riding with a mask and some gloves in the Corvette
Gotta be the coldest
I just called the bro and got some pints, I need to pour it (Baby)

[Chorus]
'Cause the whole world on lockdown, shit like a movie (it's crazy)
Do I prefer this over jail? Nigger, absolutely (fuck yeah)
I've been quarantining, playing Call of Duty (Call of Duty)
I've been getting pussy, playing Call of Duty (Call of Duty)

[Verse 3]
M13 monolithic, I'll knock your soul out
In real life, I got the same shit that's in my load out
Niggers want a handshake, I can't touch them
Trump got a billion, tell them don't forget about little bro now 
Don't forget about the people that was living check to check
Say a prayer for the ones that's in need, but they got debt
I got family that couldn't afford to close down, they're trapped
Serving with they face masks on, y'all got my respect

[Chorus]
'Cause the whole world on lockdown, shit like a movie (it's crazy)
Do I prefer this over jail? Nigger, absolutely
I've been quarantining, playing Call of Duty (Call of Duty)
I've been getting pussy, playing Call of Duty (Call of Duty)

[Verse 4]
My nigger Block just bought a rolly, he can't even go nowhere
Humidifiers going, you know that shit in the air
I don't know whose city worse right now, but say your prayer
Seven hundred people died in one day, man, say a prayer

[Chorus]
Whole world on lockdown, shit like a movie, it's crazy
Do I prefer this over jail? Nigger, absolutely
I've been quarantining, playing Call of Duty
I've been getting pussy, playing Call of Duty (Call of Duty)
I've been quarantining, playing Call of Duty 
I've been getting pussy, playing Call of Duty 
I've been quarantining, playing Call of Duty
I've been getting pussy, playing Call of Duty
