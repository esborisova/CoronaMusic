[Spoken Intro]
Now Chico, for the sake of the band, get our there and act like you got some sense
Well he's not going to get out there and act a fool
Were we talking to you?
Don't get out their plans
That's what I get out there and do every night 
It's all that I do man
I didn't come all the way from Lexington to Winchester for you to get out here and mess this up
Now act like you got some sense 
And if you do, you might get a little of this right here
This is hope money
And I hope you get out there and do your thing 
Alright man, alright 
Now Chico, don't get up there and mess it up for everybody

Florida opened up they beaches
And the going to be mad when all the cases spike
They governor really dumb 
But he won't take the blame when all the people die

Just to get infected working at Best Buy

Men and women do but numbers do not lie
