[Verse 1]
Well I heard there was a virus cure
That congress would deny for sure 
If it doesn't line the pockets of their donors
It goes like this, we all get sick
We go outside and we share the risk
Then everyone we know will get corona

[Chorus]
Get corona
Get corona 
Get corona 
Get corona 

[Verse 2]
Well our faith was strong but we needed proof
Our prayers answered nincompoop 
They say this could last months, he says bologna 
He wants us all to leave our homes
Ignores what's happening in Rome 
So if I go to work I'll get corona 

[Chorus]
Get corona
Get corona 
Get corona 
Get corona 

[Verse 3]
Well it's never been this way before 
No toilet paper at the store
Every man for himself
We're all just loners 
We wake up and get dressed to kill
Just to go Netflix and chill
Our Facebook friends all say we'll get corona

[Chorus]
Get corona
Get corona 
Get corona 
Get corona  

[Verse 4]
Can someone please just let me know 
Just where we are allowed to go
Oh I don't know who's the boss, it isn't mona
We practice social distancing 
But no one's really listening 
So stay six feet apart or get corona 

[Chorus]
Get corona
Get corona 
Get corona 
Get corona 

[Verse 5]
Maybe this will all just pass
And fall just like the price of gas
The oil companies no longer own you
Or maybe this will be our fate 
And when we're at the pearly gates
They'll ask us how we died, we got corona

[Chorus]
Got corona
Got corona 
Got corona 
Got corona 

[Outro]
Got corona
Got corona 
Got corona 
Got corona
