[Verse 1]
Ooh, fever to 101, to 101
Are you gonna to test me in time, corona
Got to make a grocery run, a grocery run
As of now I’m feeling just fine, corona

[Chorus]
Cases through the roof, it’s the truth, just turn off Fox News
They always minimize, tell their lies, we all stand to lose
My, yay, ay, ay, whoo!
My, my, my corona

[Verse 2]
Don’t stand quite so close to me, stay away
Virus gonna get in my eyes, corona
Maintain social distancing, it gets lonely
But FaceTime going to keep you alive, corona

[Chorus]
I can’t watch the stocks, giving up, there goes my IRA
Trump just talked now Dow’s, down a thousand points since yesterday
My, yay, ay, ay, whoo!
My, my, my corona
My, my, my corona

[Verse 3]
We were late on the uptake, a big mistake -
Is it just a matter of time, corona?
Is pandemic destiny our destiny
Or can we fix it with quarantine, corona?

[Chorus]
Everyone stay home, don’t you groan, just pick up the phone
We’re gonna make it through, yes it’s true, here’s what we’ve got to do
My, yay, ay, ay, whoo!
My, my, my, my, yay, ay, ay, whoo!

[Outro]
Buh-buh-buh, bye, corona
Buh-buh-buh, bye, corona
Buh-buh-buh, bye, corona
Buh-buh-buh, bye, corona
Ooooo, my corona
Ooooo, my corona
