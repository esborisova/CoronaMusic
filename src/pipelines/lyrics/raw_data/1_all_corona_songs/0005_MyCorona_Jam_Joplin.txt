[Verse 1]
Cruising ship is locking down, locking down
Quarantine for everyone, my corona
Oh, my fever's running high, running high
God, I think I'm gonna die, my corona

[Chorus]
No one's getting in, getting out, fear is growing up
Ten more people sick, every day, bodies piling up
My, my, my, aye-aye, whoa!
My Corona

[Verse 2]
Don't come any closer now, closer now,
I don't wanna get infected with, your corona
Virus spreading all around, all around
Cure is nowhere to be found, for corona

[Chorus]
No one's getting in, getting out, fear is growing up
Ten more people sick, every day, bodies piling up
My, my, my, aye-aye, whoa!
My corona

[Solo: Electric guitar]

[Verse 3]
Epidemic's running wild, running wild
Driving people out of their mind, corona
Flights are cancelled all around, all around
Is the world, coming to an end? Corona

[Chorus]
No one's getting in, getting out, fear is growing up
Ten more people gone, every day, how much more of us will
Die, die, die, aye-aye, whoa!
My corona

[Solo: Electric guitar]

[Outro]
My Corona
