[Verse 1]
If you wanna go out
You'd better think twice
Just stay home
Stay home
Keep your germs to yourself 
If you wanna be nice
Just stay home
Stay home

[Chorus]
Wash your hands
Keep them out of your face
You don't wanna cause the latest case
Think of your grannies
Think of you friends
Do it for the ones who can't defend
Just stay home

[Solo: Piano]

[Verse 2]
Read some good books
Play a fun game
But stay home
Stay home
Sing a song
Then sing it again
Just stay home
Stay home

[Chorus]
Wash your hands
Keep them out of your face
You don't wanna cause the latest case
Think of your grannies
Think of your friends
Do it for the ones who can't defend
Just stay home
Stay home
Stay home
Stay home
Stay home
Just stay home
