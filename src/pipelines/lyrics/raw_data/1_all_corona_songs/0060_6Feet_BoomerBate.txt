[Verse]
Everything is crazy kind of like Miley Cirus
Got the whole freaking world affected by a virus 
If you are like me in this time then you do not know what to do
Stick together we will be fine only hang out over Zoom 

[Verse]
Imagine all the celebrities just sitting by the pool 
Saying stay home stay alive listening to who? What a roughing 
Prayers for the affected, the sick, the jobless and the neglected
Stop the pain, hoarding the TP
Anyone know the progress on the vaccine? 
I can tell you one thing, when this thing end we are going to have a big party
Gather up our friends, we are taking trips, which flight are you on? I heard they got great cuisine in Wuhan.
You can call me batman, I am going to eat it up like a fat man
Going to china going to china 
We are going to quarantine find the vaccine 
Something in between Iâ€™m so sick and tired of all the buzz words 
Social distance, flatten the curve, I do not even know what that means anymore 
I think that they just shut down the stores
No they do not keeping in essentials 
I do not think that is what, I do not know what I am saying anymore
I am going crazy but streaming tiger king because there is just nothing else to do
Do you think Carole Baskin has killed her husband because I sure do 

[Verse]
Should I leave my house or should I stay unseen? 
I do not know what to do or even what to think
All of the voice have got a guilty hold on me
I guess my protocol is staying 6 feet, 6 feet, 6 feet 
Hoarding toile paper yelling 6 feet, 6 feet, 6 feet 
$1200 in my bank and I am yelling 6 feet 
6 feet, 6 feet 
celebrities up on the Instagram they are yelling 6 feet, 6 feet, 6 feet  
$1200 in my bank and I am yelling 6 feet

[Verse]
It is crazy times we are in everybody, it is some crazy crazy up in here
But miss no coming in and make it a little bit better 
Alright listen up I am clever 
I have been 6 feet away from everyone I love 
Mom and dad where are you at? Can I get a hug? 
Suppose I have a facemask and I have some gloves 
Even better take my hands I go scrub-a-dub
Corona corona making things weird I do not even know but I need a cold beer
I would say that I like freaking 10am, when is this madness ever going to end?
I have go to take out and I have a Zoom call, every freaking day I am wearing overalls
I am in PJs at 4pm
Oh shit carpe diem 
Pandemic here we go, Instagram is on that flow
People already know how to scroll but it is getting worse yes you already know
Corona corona is taking kind of over, what are we going to do because the party is not over
Running outside because I have 10 shoulders the are we going to reset because I am getting kind of older 
Woo take a second, listen where I am at because you know I am representing 
Trying to stay positive in this pandemic, I do not know what to do but you know I am with it
Woo, not trophy, not 60, stay far away because my rap is almost done but I am here to stay because Miss note is going to get l
What?
