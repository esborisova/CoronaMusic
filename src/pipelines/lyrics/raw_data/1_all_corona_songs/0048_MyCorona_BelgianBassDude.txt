[Verse 1]
Oh, my little pretty germ, pretty germ
You got everybody freaking out I tell you
You make my nose run, you fill my lungs
You got me weak I got to lie down, oh no no

[Chorus]
Never gonna  stop, coughing up, yellow snot
You make me feel so hot, just one touch 
Was enough for me 
Why, why, why, why? [audible coughing]
My corona 

[Verse 2]
Come a little closer now, I dare you now 
COVID-19 runs through my veins, I tell you
You're a little mystery, like Bundy
You lock me up inside and you try to kill me

[Chorus]
Never gonna stop, coughing up, yellow snot
You make me feel so hot, fever runs  
Through my gut, I said
Why, why, why, why? [audible coughing]
My corona 
My corona

[Solo: electric guitar]

[Verse 3]
When you gonna leave me? Let me be
I know it's just a matter of time, corona
Is it destiny? Destiny 
Two weeks off from work is just fine, corona

[Chorus]
Never gonna stop, coughing up, yellow snot
You make me feel so hot, fever runs  
Through my gut, I said
My, my, my, my [audible coughing]
My corona 
My corona
