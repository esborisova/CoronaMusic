[Chorus]It’s Been One week since we quarantined Said we’d all stay inside and eat our groceries Five days since you FaceTimed me Saying be symptom free or don't come and see meThree days since the living room Became my office and my work moved to all-Zoom Yesterday you'd abandoned me But it'll still be two months till we’re out of quarantine[Verse 1]Wash your hands in the kitchen sink Don't wanna be the link That gives Corona to your fellow manI stocked up on tuna fish it is a dish that lasts a year at a minimum if you can keep it in the can.[Verse 2]Don't run your errands during peak times avoid the long lines I hope you tip delivery drivers Good thing we still have Netflix Gotta watch rabbit tits and hope Legosi doesn’t eat her[Verse 3]Gotta be a flake and miss spring break Because Miami's an outbreak cough on a college kid whose conduct could be safer Gotta stop the shows Cause if they go Then the Pandemic's gonna grow Cause they are dangerous By order of the mayor[Pre-chorus]I cannot help it if I got Corona from my dad Trying hard not to cough and I feel bad I am the kind of guy who dodges their own funeral Can't even go out to eat or I'll get ill I called my senator for universal sick leave Give us rent relief or off with their heads [Chorus]It's been One week since COVID-19 Threw our plans in the air and killed our parties Five days since emergency We flatten the curve or become Italy Three days since we all cocooned We realized this thing is real and no one's immune Yesterday, someone coughed near me And it might be eighteen months till we’re out of quarantine[Interlude][Verse 4]Over in China, when some got stricken they shut Wuhan down and the virus stopped ticking Walking the dog with a mask on When everyone’s gone And if I see somebody I run[Verse 5]Like Idris Elba I might be ill Kay I don't feel ill That's hypochondria all magnified At grocery stores I'm feeling panic At home I'm manic At doctor's offices I'm terrified[Verse 6]Gonna shut down all the fitness clubs And shutter all the social hubs And tell deBlasio stay home and work your hamstrings Gotta make a joke but it’s too soon Cases balloon between the Boomers and zoomers Until we get the vaccines[Pre-chorus]How can I stop watching news, but it makes me sad Need to know why are things getting so bad We help our fellow man, and friends, that is beautiful Drop off some food like a queen for Good Will We need the science and we need the people to believe We need the tests before more people get hurt[Chorus]It's Been One week since the distancing Dropped our lives to the side for our wellbeing Five days since the testing grew and yet Still not as much as all the other nations do Three days since the briefing room He said he's not the one to blame, and what can we do? Yesterday, you just texted me Cause it'll still be two weeks till we break quarantine It'll still be two months till we break quarantine It'll still be two years till we break quarantine Close the stadium, all sports are on deep freeze Feel free to wave from there, but don’t touch me
