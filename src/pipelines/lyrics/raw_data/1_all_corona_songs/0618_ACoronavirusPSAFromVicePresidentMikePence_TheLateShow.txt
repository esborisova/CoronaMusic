[Verse 1]
We will understand the virus when we die
When we die, we will know when we die
Don't bother to wash your hands
Gay marriage is a sham
The virus has a reason
And it's all part of God's plan
Don't test vaccines on rhesus
Put your faith in Doctor Jesus
We will understand the virus when we die
