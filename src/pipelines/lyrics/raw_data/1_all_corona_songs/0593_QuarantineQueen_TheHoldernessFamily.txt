[Chorus]
If you made it out of bed 
You're a quarantine queen
If you tied up some bread
You're a quarantine queen
If you walked around the block 
You're a quarantine queen
If you match two socks
You're a queen
If you worked a whole hour
You're a quarantine queen
If you found a bag of flour
You're a quarantine queen
If you TikTok dance
You're a quarantine queen
If you put on some pants
You're a queen

[Verse 1]
Yeah, one month down, more to go
Yeah, that bar has been set really low
Used to run a company with corporate backers
Now you just trying to make a meal with some crackers
Used to work them sales projections
Now you doing Netflix selections
And you finished Orange Is the New Black
You deserve a big old pat on the back
Daddy say "momma where you keeping that broom"
Mamma say "daddy it is in the other room"
Afterward mommy put the broom away
The most productive thing you did all day
At work, you were a boss
Now you're a boss if you sort your bras
That's okay 'cause you're the queen of the quarantine

[Chorus]
If you go and get the mail
You're a quarantine queen
Keep the chips from getting stale
You're a quarantine queen
If you went up the stairs
You're a quarantine queen
If you combed your hair
You're a queen
If you got your kid online
You're a quarantine queen
If you poured yourself some wine
You're a quarantine queen
If you made pancake mixture
You're a quarantine queen
If you straightened up a picture
You're a queen

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you had very high hopes this spring
You were gonna clean out everything
You were gonna redo your work space
You were gonna move this to a new place
None of those things are gonna occur
Now that we're all locked up in here
Maybe go easy on yourself
Maybe get some nachos of the shelf
Maybe have fewer aspirations 
Maybe lower your expectations
Everybody's safe, so don't you frown
And get your sash and get your crown and

[Chorus]
Make an easy supper
You're a quarantine queen
Heat up the pasta from the tupper
You're a quarantine queen
Dirty dishes, just leave them
You're a quarantine queen
Hey, maybe the kids will clean them
You're a queen
