Covid 19 took his heart away but I really wish I had caught him slipping in the alleyway
Because I would have given him like 3 bullets to the face, you had me posted on that block right where your moma stays 
They know we going to post her and his moma we are going to smoke her
You know I always keep that poltar, there is no bluffing we are going to pop and let it go ye

[Verse]
The black from the me I let it bricks bricks, furniture will feel but you not making them flip, you make me pull up on your sonic with my money yes
Fuck the opposition when it is time we are going to get them back, yes we are going to get them niggers 
We are going to get them niggers 
I have been that block like everyday trying to drill them niggers, I am trying to put them in the grave, send his niggers with him 
Got my saddle in my brain I am not playing nigger

[Chorus]
Say, Covid 19 took his heart away but I really wish I had caught him slipping in the alleyway
Because I would have given him like 3 bullets to the face, you had me posted on that block right where your moma stays 

[Chorus]
Say, Covid 19 took his heart away but I really wish I had caught him slipping in the alleyway
Because I would have given him like 3 bullets to the face, you had me posted on that block right where your moma stays 

[Verse]
Corona took my op away but I am posting it up where does papa stay? 
Somebody has got to die today
Shoot them like the feather weight like I am hard away then fin out where is moma stays
He owes me bread he is dead I am not going to pay that, my mommy showing up the plug and try to hear that
But fuck it he can get it too, shit is about to get critical
Hi 5 get rid of him, then I am getting rid of you 

[Chorus]
Covid 19 took his heart away but I really wish I had caught him slipping in the alleyway
Because I would have given him like 3 bullets to the face, you had me posted on that block right where your moma stays 
They know we going to post her and his moma we are going to smoke her
I bet he did not know I always keep that poltar, there is no bluffing we are going to pop and let it go ye
