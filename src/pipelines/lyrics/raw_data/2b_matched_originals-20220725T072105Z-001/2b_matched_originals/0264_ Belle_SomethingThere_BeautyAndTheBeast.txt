[First song: Belle][Intro: instrumental][Intro]Little town, it's a quiet villageEvery day like the one beforeLittle town, full of little peopleWaking up to say[Pre-Chorus]Bonjour! Bonjour!Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour![Verse 1]There goes the baker with his tray, like alwaysThe same old bread and rolls to sellEvery morning just the sameSince the morning that we cameTo this poor, provincial town[Second song: Something There][Chorus from “Belle”]Oh, isn't this amazing?It's my favorite part because—you'll seeHere's where she meets Prince CharmingBut she won't discover that it's him till Chapter Three![Interlude][Verse 2]There's something sweet, and almost kindBut he was mean and he was coarse and unrefinedAnd now he's dear, and so unsureI wonder why I didn't see it there before[Interlude][Verse 3]She glanced this way, I thought I sawAnd when we touched, she didn't shudder at my pawNo, it can't be, I'll just ignoreBut then, she's never looked at me that way before[Chorus]New, and a bit alarmingWho'd have ever thought that this could be?True, that he's no Prince CharmingBut there's something in him that I simply didn't see[Verse 4]Well, who'd have thought?Well, bless my soul!Well, who'd have known?Well, who indeed? And who'd have guessedThey'd come together on their own?It's so peculiar! Wait and see!We'll wait and see, a few days moreThere may be something there that wasn't there before[Outro]You know perhaps there's something there that wasn't there beforeThere may be something there that wasn't there before
