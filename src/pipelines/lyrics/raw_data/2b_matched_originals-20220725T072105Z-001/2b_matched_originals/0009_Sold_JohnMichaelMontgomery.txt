[Verse 1]Well I went down to the Grundy County AuctionWhere I saw something I just had to haveMy mind told me I should proceed with cautionBut my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that[Chorus]And I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a signI'd give anything to make you mine all mineI'll do your bidding and be at your beck and callYeah I've never seen anyone looking so fineMan I gotta have her she's a one of a kindI'm going once, going twiceI'm sold on the lady in the second rowShe's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I knowShe's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyesAnd I'm about to bid my heart goodbye[Verse 2]Well the auctioneer was going 'bout a mile a minuteHe was takin' bids and calling them out loudAnd I guess I was really getting in itCause I just shouted out above the crowd[Chorus]And I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a signI'd give anything to make you mine all mineI'll do your bidding and be at your beck and callYeah I've never seen anyone looking so fineMan I gotta have her, she's a one of a kindI'm going once, going twiceI'm sold on the lady in the long black dressWell she won my heart it was no contestWith her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyesWell I'm about to bid my heart goodbye[Verse 3]Yeah we found love on the auction blockAnd I hauled her heart awayNow we still love to laugh aboutThe way we met that day[Chorus]When I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a signI'd give anything to make you mine all mineI'll do your bidding and be at your beck and callYeah I've never seen anyone looking so fineMan I gotta have her she's a one of a kindI'm going once, going twiceI'm sold on the lady in the second rowShe's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I knowShe's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyesAnd I'm about to bid my heart goodbye
