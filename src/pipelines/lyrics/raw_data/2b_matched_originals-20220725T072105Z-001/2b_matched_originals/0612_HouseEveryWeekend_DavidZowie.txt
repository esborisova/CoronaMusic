[Intro]
When it comes to house every weekend
When it comes to house every weekend
House every weekend, house every weekend

[Verse]
I love you, there's no need to fake it
But staying in the house every weekend, I just can't take it
I work hard
And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode
Let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode

[Drop]
When it comes to house every weekend
House every weekend, house every weekend
I work hard
House every weekend, house every weekend, house every weekend
And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode

[Bridge]
House every weekend
I just might explode
House every weekend
I just might explode

[Verse]
I love you, there's no need to fake it
But staying in the house every weekend, I just can't take it
I work hard
And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode
Let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode

[Drop]
When it comes to house every weekend
House every weekend, house every weekend
I work hard
House every weekend, house every weekend, house every weekend
And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
And if I don't let myself go, let myself go, let myself go
I just might explode
