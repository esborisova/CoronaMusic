[Verse 1]In the town of Athy one Jeremy LaniganBattered away till he hadn«t a poundAnd his father died and made him a man againLeft him a farm and ten acres of groundHe gave a grand party to friends and relationsWho did not forget him when come to the wallIf you«d only listen, I«ll make your eyes glistenAt the rows and ructions of Lanigan«s ball[Verse 2]Myself to be sure to got free invitationsFor all the nice girls and boys I might askIn less than a minute both friends and relationsWere dancing as merry as bees round a caskLashing of punch and wine for the ladiesPotatoes, cakes, there was bacon and teaThere were the Nolans, Dolans, O«Grady«sCourting the girls and dancing away[Chorus]Six long months I spent in DublinSix long months doing nothing at allSix long months I spent in DublinLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ball[Verse 3]They were doing all kinds of nonsensical polkasRound the room in a whirly gigBut Julia and I soon banished their nonsenseAnd tipped them a twist of a real Irish jigOh how the girl she really got mad and meDanced that you«d think that the ceiling would fallFor I spent three weeks at Brooks AcademyLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ball[Chorus]Six long months I spent in DublinSix long months doing nothing at allSix long months I spent in DublinLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ballAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ballAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ball[Verse 4]The boys were as merry, the girls all heartyDancing around in couples and groupsTill an accident happened, young Terence McCarthyHe put his right leg through Miss Finerty«s hoopsThe creature she fainted and cried "Meelia Murther"And called for her brothers and gathered them allCarmody swore that he«d go no furtherTill he'd satisfaction at Lanigan«s ball[Chorus]Six long months I spent in DublinSix long months doing nothing at allSix long months I spent in DublinLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ballSix long months I spent in DublinSix long months doing nothing at allSix long months I spent in DublinLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ball[Solo: Guitar][Verse 5]Boys, oh boys, «tis there was ructionsMyself got a kick from big Phelim McHughAnd I soon replied to his kind introductionAnd kicked him a terrible hullabalooCasey the piper was nearly being strangledThey squeezed up his pipes, bellows, chanters and allAnd the girls in their ribbons they all got entangledAnd that put an end to Lanigan«s ball[Chorus]Six long months I spent in DublinSix long months doing nothing at allSix long months I spent in DublinLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ballSix long months I spent in DublinSix long months doing nothing at allSix long months I spent in DublinLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ballAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ballAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againAnd I stepped out - and I stepped in againLearning to dance for Lanigan«s ball
