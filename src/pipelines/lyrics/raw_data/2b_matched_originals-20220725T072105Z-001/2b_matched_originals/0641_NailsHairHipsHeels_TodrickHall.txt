[Verse 1]
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Ass fat, lips real
Purse full, big bills
Bitch, I'm a big deal
Legs, legs, face, eyes
Thin waist, thick thighs
You, me, you wish
New phone, who this?
Pussy puss, puss, give them cunt, cunt, cunt, bitch
Mama, yes, god, then you pop that tongue, bitch
This whole club is my runway, run, bitch
Y'all five, four, three, twos, I'm a one, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, what did that girl just say, girl?
Ooh, girl, I don't dance, I work (Work)
I don't play, I slay (Slay)
I don't walk, I strut, strut, strut and then sashay (Okay)
But I don't work for free (No)
No, that's not the tea, hunty (No ma'am)
So make it rain on me (Me)
And I might let you see
What you gonna let them see?

[Chorus]
My nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
My nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels
Nails, hair, hips, heels

[Verse 2]
Head, shoulders, knees, toes
Don't know these hoes
Face, lips, eyes, nose
Camera, clik, we pose
Beat mug, limp wrists
V.I.P list
Wave, wave, blow a kiss
I'm that bitch, sis'
Left, right, left, right, left with a spin, bitch
Where's my sash and crown? 'Cause I win, bitch
I'm so fab, I'm gone with the wind, bitch
Y'all six, seven, eight, nines, I'm a ten, bitch

[Pre-chorus]
Girl, what did that girl just say, girl?
Ooh, girl, I don't dance, I work (Work)

But I don't work for free (No)
No, that's not the tea, hunty (No ma'am)
So make it rain on me (Me)
And I might let you see
What you gonna let them see?

[Chorus]
My nails, hair, hips, heels

Okay dolls, y'all know what time it is, come on
Everybody on the floor, everybody on the floor
Now I want you to stretch out those arms, stretch out those legs
Stretch out that wrist, stretch out that weave
I don't want to see you dance
I want to see you work, come on
