[Verse 1]Alone at a corner tableShe was watching me watching herI was singing about an old flame burningShe was hanging on to every wordI was pouring out my feelingsShe was pouring out the wineThrough the smoke and the beerIt was perfectly clearThat we were touching each others minds[Chorus]It was love ten feet awayImagine her in my arms, with that look on her faceLying somewhere in some shadowy placeIt was love just ten feet away[Verse 2]I just knew my closing song would do itI knew that I was heaven boundI could tell she was moved, but before I was throughThis stranger walked up and set downHe was trying his best to impress herBut she never took her eyes off meWhen he got up and left, I said to myself...Woh-o-woh what a night this will be[Chorus]It was love ten feet awayImagine her in my arms, with that look on her faceLying somewhere in some shadowy placeIt was love just ten feet away[Chorus]It was love ten feet awayImagine her in my arms, with that look on her faceLying somewhere in some shadowy placeIt was love just ten feet away
