[Verse 1]I hear the train a coming, it's rolling around the bendAnd I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know whenI'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps dragging onBut that train keeps a rolling on down to San Antone[Verse 2]When I was just a baby my mama told me, "SonAlways be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him dieWhen I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry[Interlude][Verse 3]I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining carThey're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigarsWell I know I had it coming, I know I can't be freeBut those people keep a-movingAnd that's what tortures me[Interlude][Verse 4]Well if they freed me from this prisonIf that railroad train was mineI bet I'd move it on a little farther down the lineFar from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stayAnd I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
