[Verse 1]
We three kings of Orient are;
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

[Refrain]
O star of wonder, star of light
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

[Verse 2]
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

[Refrain]
O star of wonder, star of light
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

[Verse 3]
Frankincense to offer have I;
Incense owns a Deity nigh;
Prayer and praising, voices raising
Worshipping God on high

[Refrain]
O star of wonder, star of light
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

[Verse 4]
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Sealed in the stone cold tomb

[Refrain]
O star of wonder, star of light
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

[Verse 5]
Glorious now behold Him arise;
King and God and sacrifice;
Alleluia, Alleluia
Sounds through the earth and skies

[Refrain]
O star of wonder, star of light
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
