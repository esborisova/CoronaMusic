[Verse 1]From a distanceThe world looks blue and greenAnd the snow capped mountains whiteFrom a distanceThe ocean meets the streamAnd the eagle takes to flight[Verse 2]From a distanceThere is harmonyAnd it echoes through the landIt's the voice of hopeIt's the voice of peaceIt's the voice of every man[Verse 3]From a distanceWe all have enoughAnd no one is in needAnd there are no guns, no bombs and no diseaseNo hungry mouths to feed[Verse 4]From a DistanceWe are instrumentsMarching in a common bandPlaying songs of hopePlaying songs of peaceThey are the songs of every man[Chorus]God is watching usGod is watching usGod is watching usFrom a distance[Interlude][Verse 5]From a distanceYou look like my friendEven though we are at warFrom a distanceI just cannot comprehendWhat all this fighting is for[Verse 6]From a distanceThere is harmonyAnd it echoes through the landAnd it's the hope of hopesIt's the love of lovesIt's the heart of every manIt's the hope of hopesIt's the love of lovesThis is the song of every man[Chorus]God is watching usGod is watching usGod is watching usFrom a distance
