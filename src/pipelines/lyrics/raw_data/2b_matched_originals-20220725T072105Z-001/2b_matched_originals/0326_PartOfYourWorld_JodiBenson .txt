[Intro: Spoken words]Maybe he's right. Maybe there is something the matter with meI just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad...[Verse 1]Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?Look at this trove, treasures untoldHow many wonders can one cavern hold?Looking around here you think"Sure, she's got everything"I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plentyI've got whozits and whatzits galoreYou want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!But who cares? No big deal, I want more[Verse 2]I wanna be where the people areI wanna see, wanna see them dancingWalking around on those - what do you call them? Oh - feet!Flipping your fins, you don't get too farLegs are required for jumping, dancingStrolling along down a - what's that word again? Street[Chorus]Up where they walk, up where they runUp where they stay all day in the sunWandering free - wish I could bePart of that world[Bridge]What would I give if I could live out of these waters?What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?Bet you on land they understandBet they don't reprimand their daughtersBright young women sick of swimmingReady to stand[Verse 3]I'm ready to know what the people knowAsk them my questions and get some answersWhat's a fire and why does it - what's the word? Burn?[Chorus]When's it my turn?Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?Out of the sea, wish I could be part of that world
