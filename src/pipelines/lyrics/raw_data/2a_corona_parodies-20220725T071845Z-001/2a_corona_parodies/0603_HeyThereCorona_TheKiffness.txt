[Verse 1]
Hey there corona
What's it like in New York City
Heard you got 4000 cases
And that number's pretty shitty
What to do?
No toilet paper by the loo
Can't make a poo

[Verse 2]
Hey there corona
Time's are getting pretty hard
Can't believe that just three weeks ago
Was paying bills with this guitar
Now things are bad
Can't pay my rent, it's pretty sad
My landlord's mad

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm stuck in quarantine
Oh, don't want COVID-19
Oh, I'm stuck in quarantine
Oh, don't want COVID-19

[Bridge]
This all just seems so bizarre 
Cause we've got planes and trains and cars
And that's exactly where you seem to stay
We all just made fun of you
And laughed because we kind of knew 
You wouldn't really come here anyway
Corona, I can promise you 
That by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same 
And you're to blame

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm stuck in quarantine 
Oh, don't want COVID-19
No, I don't
Oh, I’m stuck in quarantine
Oh, don't want COVID-19
Don’t want COVID-19
Oh no
No, I don't
No, I don't
