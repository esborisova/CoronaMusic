[Verse 1]
Well I went down to the Grundy county auction
But the whole damn place was empty, where are you all at?
The sound of the doors they closed for COVID-19
So I pulled out my phone and said “Google, what the hell is that?”

[Chorus 1]
And it said wash your hands and stay inside for at least two weeks and you’ll probably be fine 
Stay away from a stadiums’ bars, elevators and malls
Yeah, I can go to Walmart on my way home because I’m going a paper and a bar of soap but to my surprise there was no supplies 
They were sold out of toilet paper wouldn’t you know
I bought a box of tissues for blowing my nose
I got the last case of Jell-O and some frozen french fries
Now for two weeks I’ll be trapped inside

[Verse 2]
Well I left Walmart and I thought “hell wait one minute”
There is a CVS and a food line down the road
One of those places just has to have some TP in it
So I put the pedal down and turned up the radio

[Chorus 2]
And a man said wash your hands and stay inside for at least two weeks and you’ll probably be fine 
Stay away from a stadiums’ bars, elevators and malls
Yeah, well I checked food line and CBS for some baby wipes or even some depends
But to my surprise there were empty aisles
They’re sold out of toilet paper wouldn’t you know 
That's my last two stops nowhere left to go 
My CBS receipt will last me through the night 
But there is thirteen days until I re-supply

[Bridge]
Now you probably don’t even want to hear how I wipe my ass a day
But I got a whole system figured out it is this thing called up a day

[Chorus 3]
So now I wash my ass when i stay inside for at least two weeks and I’m doing just fine 
They closed all the bars, stadiums, theatres and malls
Hey I never thought my ass would be this clean and hell it turns out it’s yet to be seen but I’m happy now living without 
Because they should out of toilet paper wouldn’t you know theres a better way to clean your butthole
Going to play some board games to pass the time theres twelve more days left here inside
