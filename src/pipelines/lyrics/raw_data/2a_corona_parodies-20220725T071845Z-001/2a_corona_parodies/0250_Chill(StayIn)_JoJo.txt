[Verse 1]I’ve been chilling at home the past few days So you gotta facetime and talk to me To tell me how we’re gonna get through this together Hope you know that when it’s late at night Hold on to my pillow tight And wondering why you’re still going outside [Pre-chorus]I never thought Corona Could be such a nasty bitch But now that she’s here Boy all I want is for you to use common sense [Chorus]Stay in, right now Do it for humanity I’m deadass about thatBut we will survive So you gonna Learn how to cook now And practice good hygiene I know you’re bored And want to fuck around But not on me [Verse 2]Tell me why you’re acting so confused When the CDC laid it out for you Come on I know you’re not dumbTo go behind my back and hit the bar Shows how immature you really are Keep exposure to a minimum [Pre-chorus]I’d love a quarantine bae But I don’t know where your ass has been So I ain’t going down that way [Chorus]Stay in, right now Do it for humanity I’m deadass about thatBut we will survive So you gonna Learn how to cook now And practice good hygiene I know you’re bored And want to fuck around But not on me [Bridge]I wanted you right here with me But it’s a fucking quarantine And you know I’m horny But let’s heed the warnings You been out doing God knows what Breathing and touching everyone And I refuse to die I’m gonna keep my ass inside [Chorus]Stay in, stay in, stay in, yeah Cause I know we’re all bored That’s for sure But you gotta follow the rules I know you’re bored and want to go buckwildBut don’t do it
