[Verse 1]You can’t hug me You can’t kiss me Stay six feet away Don’t get near me Without gloves on For fourteen more days If you sneeze or have a cough You’ll sleep in the next room But don’t worry we’ll still cuddle Virtually on Zoom[Chorus]‘Cause we are living in a pandemic world And I won’t be your corona girl You know that we are living in a pandemic world And I won’t be your corona girl [Interlude][Verse 2]No more golfing  No more sports On my big screen television Now you’re stuck with interacting every day with me Someday we will dance together Wo knows when that might be But for now put on your mask And get away from me [Chorus]‘Cause we are living in a pandemic world And I won’t be your corona girl You know that we are living in a pandemic world And I won’t be your corona girl [Interlude][Verse 3]So far now let’s keep our distance And hope you’re doing well Do you love me for my mind Or just for my Purell [Chorus]‘Cause we are living in a pandemic world And I won’t be your corona girl You know that we are living in a pandemic world And I won’t be your corona girl [Interlude]Corona girl Ooh Corona girl Ooh Corona girl Ooh
