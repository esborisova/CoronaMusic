[Intro]
Tell them how it is, Mr. Adams
I promise, I'm gonna keep our students safe

[Verse 1]
Back to school, we all back to school now
Back to school, we all back to school
Represent, we got to represent
That's no lie, we got to represent

[Chorus]
Mask on, you got to put that mask on
Mask on, you got to keep that mask on 
Keep your mask on to help prevent corona
You got to do it, even, even if you don't wanna
So mask up, do it for me and you
Do it for your crew too

[Chorus]
Mask on, you got to put your mask on
Mask on, you got to keep the masks on
Strap your mask on to mitigate corona
'Cause that what it takes, to get back to normal
So mask up, for me and you
Mask up, do it for your crew too

[Verse 2]
Always could only walk one way
Can't make you mad please
"But my class is right over there"
You know what, I just don't care

[Verse 3]
Too many sick, we cannot take those risks
So follow those, follow those arrows
Six feet, you gotta keep six feet
Six feet, you gotta keep six feet
Social distance, you gotta social distance
Social distance, you gotta social distance

[Chorus]
Mask on, you got to put that mask on
Mask on, you got to keep that mask on 
Sanitize, you got to sanitize too
Sanitize, even do it times two
