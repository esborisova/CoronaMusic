[Verse 1]
On the land, the air and sea
Lives a virus that spreads with ease 
It has caused much misery
As it disrupts normality
So the lot all moved indoors
To help keep it from spreading more
Now we all are family
Living quarantine 

[Chorus]
We all live in Corona Quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
We all live in Corona Quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 

[Verse 2]
Most our friends are all on board
Hello friends 
Except from some of them
Who just ignore 
What the hell?
And to them I have to say
What is wrong with you?
Please pull your head out of your ass, gah

[Chorus]
We all live in Corona Quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
We all live in Corona Quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 

[Spoken]
Ah yeah that's imperative
Wash you hands please
Don't touch
Stop buying all the toilet paper
Get away from me
Social distance
Hey, would you just stay home, for god's sake?
Please. wash your hands
No don't go to the bar
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
Stop buying all the toilet paper

[Verse 3]
As we live with worry 
Trying to keep, trying to keep
Up positivity, posistity
To the rest, to the rest
We all agree, all agree
We wish you'd take, we wish you'd take
This seriously, seriously 

[Chorus]
We all live in Corona Quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
We all live in Corona Quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 

[Chorus]
We all live in Corona Quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
We all live in Corona Quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine 
Corona quarantine
