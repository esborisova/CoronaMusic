[Verse 1]In the town of Wuhan some germs from an animal Made a big leap and infected a few Nobody thought it would be a pandemic And now the whole world’s in a hullabaloo [Verse 2]It didn’t take long for the germs to go globalIn planes and trains and cruises by sea No lock in our homes and trying to stay sober We can’t even watch the life sports on television [Chorus]Six long months in isolation Six long months doing nothing at all Six long months in isolation This lockdown is driving me up the wall I tried to go out got sent in back again I went out again straight back in again Sick to death of this social distancing Finish the lockdown for once and for all [Verse 3]The experts say keep two meters distance And never to gather in couples and groupsAnd [????] disaster [???] pasta and soups [Verse 4]Now in the UK the virus was active And got the prime minister in number ten I hope Boris Johnson recovers completely so that we can call him a dick head again [Chorus]Six long months in isolation Six long months without toilet rollI wished to God I had constipation Because I have nothing for wiping me hole I tried to go out got sent in back again I went out again straight back in again Sick to death of this social distancing Finish the lockdown for once and for all [Verse 5]Not Trump took I lightly there’s no need to panicWe’re under control sure it is only a flu He finally did what he promised [???] America [???] The infections too [Chorus]Three long years with Trump as President Three long years there was nothing at allTalking shit and blaming China When Mexico begs him to finish the wall I tried to go out got sent in back again I went out again straight back in again Sick to death of this social distancing Finish the lockdown for once and for all [Verse 6]The end is in sight and the curve it has flattenedLifting the lockdown is yet to be seen Washing your hands and staying at homeIs the only solution for COVID-19[Chorus]Six long months in isolation The planet has never looked cleaner before But back to the [???] to pay off the mortgage The world just won’t be the same anymore
