[Verse 1]
Ooh
Yesterday, COVID-19 seemed so far away
Now it look as though it's here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday 

[Verse 2]
Suddenly, I'm spending three whole weeks in quarantine 
Is this virus taking over me?
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
My bottle store had to close
No more booze from Pick and Pay
I can't even see my mom for 20 days

[Verse 3]
Yesterday, loadshedding was the only price to pay
Now I'm stuck at home with bills to pay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why's she blowing her nose? 
I don't know, she wouldn't say
Is that a dry cough?
Can you stay the hell away

[Verse 4]
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now my wife is two meters away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Ooh
