[Vers 1]Oh yeah, I touched that somethingI think you understand Now I need a scrubbing I gotta wash my hands [Chorus]I gotta wash my handsI gotta wash my hands [Vers 2]Don’t sneeze next to me Watch where those droplets land To freeze this disease I gotta wash my hands [Chorus] I gotta wash my handsI gotta wash my hands[Bridge]‘Cause if I catch itI’ll feel crappy inside I even want my latex gloves Sanitized, sanitized, sanitized [Vers 3]Yeah, I leaned this one thing The 20-second plan Now my water’s running I gotta wash my hands [Chorus] I gotta wash my handsI gotta wash my hands[Bridge]‘Cause if I catch itI’ll feel crappy inside I even want my latex gloves Sanitized, sanitized, sanitized[Vers 4]Yeah, I touched that somethingI think you understand Now I need a scrubbing I gotta wash my hands [Chorus] I gotta wash my handsI gotta wash my handsI gotta wash my hands
