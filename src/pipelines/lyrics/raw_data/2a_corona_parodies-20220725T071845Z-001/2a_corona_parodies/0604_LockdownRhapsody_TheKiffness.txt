[Verse 1]
This is the real life
This isn't fantasy
Caught in a lockdown
No escape from the quarantine

[Verse 2]
Time really flies
If you just keep yourself busy
Three weeks at home, boy
You could write your own symphony

Or you could play the drum, learn to sow
Watch your favorite TV show
Stare outside the window
Just stop the spread of COVID-19
