[Verse]
Long lines at Costco and fights over baskets, empty shelves at targets and checkout lines with caskets 
People buying enough TP to last until spring, these are a few of my least favorite things

[Verse]
Do not care if it is from China or from Timbuktu, I just want to know what it is I should do
Kids staying home through 8 in the spring, these are a few of my least favorite things

[Verse]
Groups of 10 people or more all in on spot, do not hang out where it is cold or even where it is hot
The gyms are all closed too many people in one place, now the pounds will soon appear round my waist

[Chorus]
Where the shoppers fight, where the carts run out, where the wipes are gone
Then I simply say out loud this one thing, I hope it will not last too long
