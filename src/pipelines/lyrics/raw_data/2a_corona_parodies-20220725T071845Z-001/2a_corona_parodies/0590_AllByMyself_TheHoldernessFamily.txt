[Verse 1]
I'm an extrovert
I constantly need someone
I'd go to parties, they were fun
Those days are done
Saying hello
I'd hug everyone I know
Especially if you're a bro
I can't do that no more

[Chorus]
All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself anymore

[Verse 2]
Even my spouse 
She's introverted like a mouse
But she needs to leave the house
She needs to get out

[Chorus]
'Cause now she's all by herself
Usually she likes it but now 
Doesn't wanna be all by herself mostly indoors yeah
She's all by herself
No she don't wanna be all by herself anymore

[Spoken word]
Lost my voice there at the end
That was high
Was that hot?
No that was high
Yeah it was high, there's the piano solo

[Solo: Recorder]
