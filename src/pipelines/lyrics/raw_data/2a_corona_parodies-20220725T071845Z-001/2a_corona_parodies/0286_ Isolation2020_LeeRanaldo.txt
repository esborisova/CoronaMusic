[Verse 1] People say we got it made Don’t they know it’s so afraid? Isolation [Verse 2]We are afraid to be alone But everybody got to have a home Isolation[Verse 3]Just a boy and a little girl Trying to change our whole world Isolation [Verse 4]The world is just a little town Everybody trying to pull us down Isolation [Chorus]I don’t expect you To understand After you’ve caused So much pain But the again You’re not to blame You’re just a human A victim of the insane [Verse 5]We’re afraid of everyone Afraid of the sun Isolation [Verse 6]The sun will never disappear But the world may not have many years Isolation
