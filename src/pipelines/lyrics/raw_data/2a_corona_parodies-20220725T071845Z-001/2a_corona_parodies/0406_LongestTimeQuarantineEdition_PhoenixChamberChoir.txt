[Chorus]Woah, for the longestFor the longest time Woah, for the longest For the longest time [Verse 1]I have been at home in quarantine Stopping spread if COVID-19 What else could I doDon’t want this virus from youI haven’t left here for the longest time [Verse 2]Exercise by jogging around my room Online meetings taking place on Zoom Though this is saferWe’re out of toilet paper We haven’t left here for the longest time [Chorus]Woah, for the longestFor the longest time Woah, for the longest For the longest time [Verse 3]Teachers try to teach their kids online Somehow this needs twice as much preparation time Self-isolationIs how we help our nation We’re haven’t left here for the longest time [Bridge]Maybe this won’t last very long There’s no end in sight Though I could be wrong Maybe I’ve been hoping too hard But we’ve come this far And the curve’s getting flatter [Verse 4]If you choose to venture out today Stay at least two meters away Can’t take no chances Given certain circumstances We will be at home for the longest time [Bridge]I had hopeful thoughts at the start I said to myself – I will do my part Washing hands Not touching my face I long for your embrace And it’s all that I hope for [Verse 5]It’s my job to do all the right things Social distancing as I sing I miss you so bad But I think you ought to know that I intend to stay here for the longest time [Chorus]Woah, for the longestFor the longest time Woah, for the longest For the longest time Woah, for the longestFor the longest time Woah, for the longest For the longest time
