[Verse]
I have been trapped in my house now for 7 days turning into a zombie a corona fueled haze
Now I live in my PJ’s and I do not wash my hair 
I was going to shower but I just do not care 
My fiancé is driving me crazy, 2 weeks of just us, oh lord
I have called off the wedding twice the called it back on because I was bored
When will things be normal? I even miss going to work
Too much time for self reflection, turns out I am kind of a jerk

[Chorus]
Welcome to the hotel quarantine-ah, where we stay in place to save the human race 
Plenty of room at the hotel quarantine-ah, someone give me a sign, I am almost out of wine

[Verse]
Groceries dropped on the doorstep, FaceTime drinking with friends
If I cannot find toilet paper soon I am going to have to start wearing depends
I see those dummies on spring break and I want to give them a kick 
I hope karma gets them because it is not them who gets sick 
I wish I knew how this all ends, are we here for 1 month or 8? 
Do I focus on broccoli? Or can I start eating cake? 
How we will beat this pandemic, it is just so hard to say
But for now, just stay the fuck at home and they will find a way

[Chorus]
Welcome to the hotel quarantine-ah, where we stay inside until corona subsides 
Plenty of room at the hotel quarantine-ah, we have all got time to kill so let us all Netflix and chill
