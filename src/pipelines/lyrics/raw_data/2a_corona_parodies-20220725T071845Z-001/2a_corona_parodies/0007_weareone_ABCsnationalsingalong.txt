[Chorus]
We are one but we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We share a dream
And sing with one voice 
I am, you are, we are Australian 

[Chorus]
We are one but we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We share a dream
And sing with one voice 
I am, you are, we are Australian 
We are Australian
