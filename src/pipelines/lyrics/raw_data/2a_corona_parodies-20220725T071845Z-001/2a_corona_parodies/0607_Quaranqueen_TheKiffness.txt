[Chorus]
Ooh yeah
I'm not wearing pants, I'm deprived 
I've lost track of time and my life
Ooh, has no routine, my name's Colleen
I am the quaran-queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and my wine stock's low
I've literally got no place to go
I try to find a good series to forget everything
I find the Tiger King
He's married to some real weird guys
Carol Baskin's living a lie
She fed her husband to tigers
Everything is not fine
Very weird circumstance
This show's got me in a trance

[Chorus]
'Cause I am the quaran-queen
I lost my mind on day 17
Quaran-queen eating bread without margarine oh yeah
I'm not wearing pants, I'm deprived 
I've lost track of time and my life
Ooh, has no routine, I watch that screen
'Cause I am the quaran-queen
