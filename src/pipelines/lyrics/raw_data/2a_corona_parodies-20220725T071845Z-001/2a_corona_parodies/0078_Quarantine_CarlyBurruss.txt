[Chorus]
Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine I am begging of your please don’t shake my head
Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine do not go to Kroger just because you can

[Verse]
You started out across the sea and then you made your way to me and now I am ready to foresee quarantine
If you have got cough and your throat is sore, get inside and close that door, do not let us see your face no more quarantine 

[Chorus]
Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine I am begging of your please don’t shake my head
Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine do not go to Kroger just because you can

[Verse]
And to all the people flying off the shelf, beans sold out right enough, I hope you are all stocked up on pot pure
I will see you all on the other side, fat, sassy and terrified here at the CDC in quarantine

[Chorus]
Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine I am begging of your please don’t shake my head
Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine Quarantine do not go to Kroger just because you can

[Ending]
Oh please do not you dare shake my hand, just stay inside as long as you can
