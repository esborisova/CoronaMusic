[Verse 1]Been a hundred and four days Since social insolation We don’t really know end it So the quarantine problem of our generation Is finding a good way to spend itLike maybe [Chorus]Finding a hobbyOr fighting your family Or check in if the milk’s gone sour Discovering toilet paper no longer exist So I’m giving myself a third shower Starting a Facebook liveApplying for a job while keeping six feet away Watch a Netflix series Refurnish furniture Just trying to keep myself sane [Verse 2]As you can see there’s a whole lot of stuff to do Before school starts online [Outro]So stay at home ‘cause COVID-19Could really heard us all So stay at home ‘cause COVID-19 Could really heard us all [Spoken words]Mom, Tess only washed hands for nineteen seconds.
