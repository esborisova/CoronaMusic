[Chorus 1]
COVID-19
Oh, I swear you’re so mean
From this moment 
You wrecked everything
Are you in my chest? 
Dry cough, I confess 
Earth is dirty
From COVID-19, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
My poor old 401K
The stock market is strangling 
Because a bat hooked up with a pangolin and 

[Chorus 2]
COVID-19
The stores are out of TP 
Now my toilet
Needs one of those bidet things
Now that sports are all done 
What will I do for fun 
See my family?
No thanks, COVID-19 

[Verse 2]
Cleanliness is key 
Please do not shake hands with me 
And wash real good after you poop and pee 'cause 

[Chorus 3]
COVID-19 
Please give me six feet 
Of a bubble
If you are unclean
Social distance is best 
No symptoms, no test 
Don’t catch stupid 
From COVID-19 

[Verse 3]
People stay away 
Luckily, since I turned 13
Everybody stays six feet away from me 'cause 

[Chorus 1]
COVID-19
Oh, I swear you’re so mean
From this moment
You’ve wrecked everything
Are you in my chest? 
Dry cough, I confess 
Earth is dirty from COVID-19 

[Chorus 1]
COVID-19
Oh, I swear you’re so mean
From this moment
You’ve wrecked everything
Are you in my chest? 
Dry cough, I confess 
Earth is dirty from COVID-19
