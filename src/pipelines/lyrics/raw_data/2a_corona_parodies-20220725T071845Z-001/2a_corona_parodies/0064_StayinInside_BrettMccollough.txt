[Verse 1]
Well you can tell by the way I wash my hands
I'm Corona free, won't take no chance
Toilet paper and latex gloves 
I've been ready for this since I was born
And now it's alright, it's okay
You may look the other way
You can try to understand 
The Coronavirus' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're staying inside, staying inside
Feel the city breaking and everyone shaking 
We're staying inside, staying inside
Ha ha ha ha, staying inside, staying inside
Ha ha ha ha, staying inside

[Outro]
It's the corona 
Somebody help us
Somebody help us yeah
It's the corona 
Somebody help us yeah
I'm staying inside
