
[Verse 1]
Third lockdown 
2021 and it’s a little bit lonely 
No-one’s ever coming round 
Third lockdown 
2021 we bet we’d all be outside 
But I’m still listening to the sound of their tears 
Third lockdown 
Every day I’m treated like I offer room service 
But they mess it in the blink of an eye 
Third lockdown 
Every now and then we get a little bit terrified 
Of when we think she’s gonna let fly 
Third lockdown – time flies 
Struggling to tell the days apart 
Third lockdown – time flies 
Feels as if we’re only at the start

[Chorus]
But we’ve grown a lot in height 
There’s no way for us to measure 
And if you look our clothes are tight 
We’ve been eating more than ever 
All the screens must be harming our sight 
‘Cause we’re on all day long 
Together we once limited the hours online 
Now someone’s got the Xbox One on all of the time 
All of the tome 
I don’t know what to do 
We work in fits and start 
We’re sitting in pajamas making catty remarks
We’re really feeling uptight 
My bedroom’s like a building site 
Their bedroom’s like a building site 

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time, we could travel abroad 
Not we barely get in the car 
There’s nothing we can do 
We’re totally fixed where we are 
Once upon a time, we went hiking for miles 
But now we can’t be arsed with the park 
Nothing we can say
We’re totally fixed where we are 

[Instrumental part]
      
[Chorus]
Used to be bright eyes 
Struggling to tell the days apart 
Now lord of the flies 
Feels as if we’re right back at the start 
And we leave on all the lights 
And we leave them on 
I don’t close the doors in winter 
Dad said use only black and white 
If we only 
We’ve been ruining the printer
And we’ll always be picking a fight 
No we never 
‘Cause they’ll never be wrong 
Together we have flouted all our parents’ red lines 
We’re physically older but in mental decline 
Mental decline 
We won’t go back to school 
Until the eighth of March 
Just sitting in our dressing gowns and giving off farts 
We’re really feeling irate 
Like bears, that never hibernate 
Forever in a lockdown state 

[Outro]
One upon a time, we were singing Les Mis 
But now it’s eighties songs from the charts 
Nothing we can say 
We’re totally fixed where we are 
We’re totally fixed where we are 
We’re totally fixed where we are 
Lord of the flies
