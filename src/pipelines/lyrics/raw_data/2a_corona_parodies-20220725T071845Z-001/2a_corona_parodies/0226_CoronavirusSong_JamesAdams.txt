[Verse 1]Quarantine is now upon us I work from home, online tutorials COVID-19, what must this beGot a cough, you must isolate Don’t go out and spread it just work the pace COVID-19, don’t you agreeI cannot go to sleep, tomorrow is a repeat [Chorus]All right, got nothing to doNo sports or TV shows Just stuck watching the news So come on, come on, come on This shit’s critical Stay in, there ain’t a choice Don’t go panic shopping Or go hang with the boys So come on, come on, come on What’s do difficult [Verse 2]Inside the house thorough social distancing Loss for apps to download, sick of playing COVID-19, can you help meWhy is the weather so goddamn niceI shouldn’t be inside, streaming it all I cannot go to sleepThis boredom is haunting me [Chorus]All right, got nothing to doNo clubs or McDonald’s Just stuck watching the news So come on, come on, come onMust stay physical Stay in, keeping your cool Streamed the whole on Netflix And made this song for youSo come on, come on, come on This shit’s critical [Bridge]Hold on, just a little longer Come on, not out Stay inside a little bit more Yeah, keep on waiting What’s so difficult Hold on, just a little longer Come on, not out Stay inside a little bit more Yeah, keep on waiting What’s so difficult [Chorus]All right, got nothing to doI’ll join a TikTok dance Got nothing else to do So come on, come on, come on This chit’s critical Stay in, there ain’t no choice Don’t go panic shopping Or go hang with the boys So come on, come on, come on What’s so difficult This shit’s critical Cynical, must stay physical Come on, c-c-c-critical
