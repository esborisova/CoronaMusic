[Verse 1]
I've been washing my hands so long
Who knew I always did it wrong
All the sanitizer has got them cracked and bleeding
And my phone keeps blowing up 
With news reports that the world is shutting down
There has been a load of misdirection
Surrounding this infection
And it's scaring the bejesus out of me

[Chorus]
Coronavirus
Freaking everybody out
It's the worst thing we've ever seen
Coronavirus
A sniffle or a sneeze
And you've got to go in quarantine
So stock up on TP

[Verse 2]
The stock market went in the tank
The moment it got Tom Hanks
They canceled all the basketball and hockey
But the kids all think it's cool
'Cause they'll probably be out of school 'till Halloween
This pandemic's spreading quickly
So if you're feeling sickly
We're going to treat you 
Like you have Leprosy

[Chorus]
Coronavirus
Freaking everybody out
It's the worst thing we've ever seen
Coronavirus
A sniffle or a sneeze
And you've got to go in quarantine
So stock up on TP
Coronavirus
