[Verse 1]My mommy is afraidShe is terrified Something I can miss is to go outsideBut for me it means she’s staying home and I won’t be alone Right now it means more hugs and kissThan I have never known[Chorus]We will survive We’ll stay inside I don’t know who corona is or COVID-19All I know is me and mama having so much funThe kids are all [???] but there’s no playing in the sun[Chorus]We will stay safe We’ll stay inside We need to follow rules and not go spreading it outside I know it will change [???] but right now I love my life My mom’s at home with me and it’s the best time of my life [Chorus]There’s time to read We’ve got all we needWe’ve been watching television till we both fall fast asleepSometimes we don’t even know what day it is And I know she’s worried and afraid, but I keep up warming faith Hey hey [Spoken words]Please stay home and stay safe
