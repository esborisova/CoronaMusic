[Verse 1]
Hello virus from Wuhan
Another problem's here again 
Because you see the contagion creeping
And the virus is indeed spreading
And the memory of SARS planted in my brain
Still remains
We stand and fight the virus

[Verse 2]
We hear of theories, how it grew
From snakes and bats became a flu
Passing the sickness from man to man
Now it's growing, getting out of hand
It's a virus, that has travelled near and far
Corona
We have to fight the virus

[Verse 3]
And in the latest news I saw
Ten thousand people maybe more
People falling sick with much coughing
People falling ill with much sneezing
People worried for their health and their ones so dear
Pneumonia
We keep the fight, the virus

[Verse 4]
Keep your hands clean alway told
Hygiene will stop that virus grow
When you sneeze cover with a tissue
Even coughing, just let me teach you 
Wear a mask if you're sick 
So that others won't get it too
We count on you
To help to fight the virus 

[Verse 5]
Together we must overcome
To beat this virus fight as one
For a life of health and harmony
It's in our hands, it's up to you and me
For the health of our land
Of our friends and family
Humanity
We will win this fight, the virus
