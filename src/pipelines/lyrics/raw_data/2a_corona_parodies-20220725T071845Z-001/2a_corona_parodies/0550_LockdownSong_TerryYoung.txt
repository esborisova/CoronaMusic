[Intro]
If you had one shot
One moment
And one opportunity
To leave the house, what would you do?
Would you smell some fresh air?
Or would you get some more toilet paper?

[Verse 1]
Yo
It's lockdown already 
All the streets are so empty
I eat the same old damn thing everyday
Mom's spaghetti
I'm bored, can't hit the gym
To get fit and healthy
Instead all that I'm working on is my belly
And I can't go out
Can't walk my dog around 
I wanna breakout
All I wanna do is workout
I'm so burned out
And everybody's coughing now 
The eggs ran out 
But I want an omelette now
Been days since I've seen a tree
Weeks since I've used my key
Can't go travel overseas
Not even on a shopping spree
Yo
I'm spending more time with my little family
All they wanna do is read books 
And drink a cup of tea
Gross, I smell bad, I need soap
But all the shops they have closed 
No washing powder for clothes 
Feeling so dirty, yo 
It's dinner time once again
Mom's spaghetti never ends
All I want is a Big Mac
And to play with my friends 

[Chorus]
Corona, please go home 
Leave us alone
Mom's binging Game of Thrones
Got no more things to download on my phone
I've only got one slice of bread
In my house, you know
Can't leave my house though
'Cause I'm in lockdown 
Corona go away
I wanna play 
You made me break my arm today 
I need to leave my house to get an x-ray
It only takes one cough 
And you're in isolation mode
Can't leave my house, yo
'Cause I'm still in lockdown

[Verse 2]
I feel like escaping 
But my mom is always waiting
Today she made me join in with the baking
I can't cook, mom
Thinking about Corona 
Wake up and grab my phone
Check news about Corona
Everywhere I look
Corona
But I know we'll beat corona
And soon we'll all get stronger
There'll be no more lockdown orders
Then I can cross the border
Get to leave the house 
Smell some fresh air, move about
Then buy mom more milk
'Cause she just ran out

[Chorus]
Corona, please go home 
Leave us alone
You're making all the sport postpone
Liverpool fans are gonna moan 
I've only got one slice of cheese
In my fridge, you know
Can't leave my house, yo
'Cause I'm in lockdown 
Oh, Corona go away
I wanna play 
I really need a holiday
I wanna drive my damn car on the highway 
It only takes one cough 
And you're in isolation mode
Can't leave my house, yo
'Cause I'm still in lockdown
Not even the flu shot
Will help you to be cured 
Just be safe, yo
And stay in lockdown 
Lockdown, lockdown
I'm in lockdown 
Lockdown, lockdown
Still in lockdown 
Lockdown, lockdown
I'm in lockdown 
Lockdown, lockdown
Stay in lockdown 
Lockdown, lockdown
I'm in lockdown
