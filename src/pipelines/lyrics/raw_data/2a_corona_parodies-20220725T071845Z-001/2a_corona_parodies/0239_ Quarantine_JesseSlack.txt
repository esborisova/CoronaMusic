[Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantineCorona stay away, don’t infect me Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantineI’m hiding out from you COVID-19[Verse 1]They say you’re stuck in quarantine, can’t leave the for two weeks And I’m sure glad I’ve got a stockpile of toilet paperIt’s good and soft, cashmere kind, it won’t chafe up my behind Well, I’m stuck here on the couch in quarantine They’ve canceled all the sports, you see There’s nothing left on my TVSo Netflix you finally got me to subscribe I’ve watched every TV-series, action, flick, and comedy So now there’s nothing left but Love Is Blind[Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantineCorona stay away, don’t infect me Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantineI’m hiding out from you COVID-19[Verse 2]There’s rums at the liquor store It’s closing down, they locked the doorsAnd how will I survive without Jim BeamCause all I’ve been is drunk and stoned Ever since the news story broke Because there’s nothing else to do in quarantine [Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantineCorona stay away, don’t infect me Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantineI’m hiding out from you COVID-19I’m hiding out from you COVID-19
