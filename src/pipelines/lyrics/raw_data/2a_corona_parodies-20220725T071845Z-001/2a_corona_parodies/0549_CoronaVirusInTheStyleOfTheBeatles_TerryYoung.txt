[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, I touched that something
I think you understand
Now I need a scrubbing
I gotta wash my hands
I gotta wash my hands
I gotta wash my hands

[Verse 2]
Don't sneeze next to me
Watch where those droplets land
To freeze this disease
I gotta wash my hands
I gotta wash my hands
I gotta wash my hands

[Chorus]
'Cause if I catch it I'll feel crappy inside
I even want my latex gloves
Sanitized, sanitized, sanitized

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I learned this one thing
The 20 second plan
Now my water's running
I gotta wash my hands 	
I gotta wash my hands
I gotta wash my hands

[Chorus]
'Cause if I catch it, I'll feel crappy inside
I even want my latex gloves
Sanitized, sanitized, sanitized

[Verse 4]
Oh yeah, I touched that something
I think you understand
Now I need a scrubbing
I gotta wash my hands
I gotta wash my hands
I gotta wash my hands
I gotta wash my hands
