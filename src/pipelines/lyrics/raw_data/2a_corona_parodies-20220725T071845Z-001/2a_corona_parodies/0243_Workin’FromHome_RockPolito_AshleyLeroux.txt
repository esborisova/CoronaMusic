[Verse 1]
We all used to go to our jobs
Then COVID broke out
They sent us all home, at home 
Ooh we’re home
Now I wear my sweatpants all day
Working on the couch and watching TV at home
Oooh at home 

[Pre-chorus]
They say we’ve gotta stay home but we can walk out dogs
Doesn’t matter if you got a mask or not 
We’ve got good bandwidth and that’s a lot for work
For YouTube and stuff

[Chorus]
Woah, we’re on the phone
Woah, working from home 
Checking emails and meeting on Zoom
Woah, working from home 

[Verse 2]
I just can’t stop washing my hands 
And I think it’s been days since I put on pants at home 
Oooh at home 
My kids will soon be climbing the walls
I lock them outside when I take my calls at home
Oooh at home 

[Pre-chorus]
They say we gotta stay home except the grocery store 
I’m hiding toilet paper form the neighbors next door 
We’ve got some liquor, but we need more at home
Go lock the front door

[Chorus]
Woah, we’re on the phone
Woah, working from home 
Checking emails and meeting on Zoom
Woah, working from home 
Working from home

[Solo: Guitar]

[Bridge]
Oh we’ve got to hold on and do our jobs
Watching Netflix cause that’s all that we’ve got

[Chorus]
Woah, we’re watching movies
Woah, and rocking Bon Jovi
Shut up your dog or mute the microphone
Woah, working from home 

Woah, we’re on the phone
Woah, working from home 
Checking emails and meeting on Zoom
Woah, working from home 

[Outro]
Working from home
