
[Verse 1]
Keep your distance 
The world’s in quarantine  
And we should all just stay inside 
Keep your distance 
No, this is not a dream 
Maybe time to change your flight 
Keep your distance 
Stay away from me 
Remember to wash your hands 
Stay inside your home 
No seriously, stay inside you home 
Stay inside for as long as you can 

[Chorus]
High infections rates 
So don’t touch your face 
For the human race
Keep your distance
