[Verse 1]Alone in one bedroom corner I was watching Ige give the news He said, my hands gotta clean ÔCause of this COVID-19 And he said we canÕt date Gotta isolate [Verse 2]Josh Green said, weÕve gotta quarantine And we gotta try to flatten the curve Caldwell said, you go home You gotta work from your phone And the world gave us a strong public service announcement(so you better listen) [Chorus]YouÕve gotta stay six feet away You might have a positive case So stay out of my face WeÕll be safer I hope you bought toilet paper You gotte stay six feet away You gotte stay six feet away You might have a positive case So stay out of my face WeÕll be safer I hope you bought toilet paper YouÕve gotta stay six feet away
