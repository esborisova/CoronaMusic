[Intro]If you had one shot One moment And one opportunity To leave your house What would you do Would you smell some fresh air Or would you get some more toilet paper [Verse 1]Yo! It’s lockdown already All the streets are so empty I eat the same old damn thing everyday Mom’s spaghetti I’m board Can’t even hit the gym To get fit and healthy Instead all that I‘m working on is my belly And I can’t go out Can’t walk my dog around I wanna break out All I wanna do is workoutI’m so burnt out And everybody’s coughing nowThe eggs ran out But I want an omelette now[Verse 2]Benn days since I’ve seen a treeWeeks since I’ve used my keysCan’t go travel overseas Not even on a shopping spreeThough I’m spending more time With my little family All they wanna do is read books And drink a cup of teaGross, I smell bad I need soap But all the shops they have closed No washing powder or clothes Feeling so dirty, yo It’s dinner time once again Mom’s spaghetti never ends All I want is a Big Mac And to play with my friends [Hook]Oh, corona please go home Leave us alone Mama’s binging Game of Thrones Got no more things to download on my phone I’ve only got one slice of bread In my house you know Can’t leave my house though ‘Cause I’m in lockdownCorona go away I wanna play You made me break my arm today I need to leave my house to get an X-ray It only takes one cough And you’re in isolation mode Can’t leave my house, yo ‘Cause I’m still in lockdown [Verse 3]I feel like escaping But my mum is always waiting Today she made me join in with the baking I can’t cook, mumThinking about corona Wake up grab my phone Check news about corona Everywhere I lookCorona!But I know we’ll beat corona And soon we’ll all get stronger There be no more lockdown orders Then I can cross the border Get to leave the house Smell some fresh air move about Then buy mum more milk ‘cause she just ran out [Hook]Corona please go home Leave us alone You’re making all the sports postpone Liverpool fans are gonna moan, oh I’ve only got one slice of cheese In my fridge you knowCan’t leave the house, yo‘cause I’m in lockdown Corona go awayI wanna playI really need a holiday I wanna drive my damn car on the highway It only takes one cough And you’re in insolation mode Can’t leave my house, yo‘cause I’m still in lockdown Not even the flu shot will help you to be cured Just be safe, yoAnd stay in lockdown Lockdown, lockdown I’m in lockdown, lockdownLockdown Still in lockdown,Lockdown, lockdown Stay in lockdown, lockdownLockdown I’m in lockdown
