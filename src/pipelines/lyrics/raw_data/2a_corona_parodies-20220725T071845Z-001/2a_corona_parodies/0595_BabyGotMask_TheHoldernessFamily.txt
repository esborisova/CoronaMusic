[Verse 1]
This school thing sucks and I cannot lie
But a lot of us are gonna try
To let our boy and girl walk into a class
And hope that this will last
More than a month
Well, it might be rough
And wearing that mask is tough
Glasses are hard for seeing
They fog up when you're breathing
Oh baby, I'll paint you a picture
Your friends are with you 
But your homeboys in this instance
Gotta keep six feet of distance
Uh, that's the rule yo
You wanna be good to go
Then when we send you back again
You can't be out there tackling
Lots of restrictions
And tough decisions
But one thing that is true
The teachers are there for you
They're cleaning up that class, son
And dancing with a skeleton
And all wearing a mask, son
Give you an education

[Chorus]
So fellas, yeah
Fellas, yeah
Do you wanna go back to class?
Oh yeah
Then take it, take it
Take it, take it
Take that thing to class
Baby got mask
It's a party over here
Baby got mask, yeah
You know what else?

[Verse 2]
I like them big and round 
So they cover my mouth
And don't try to lose it, try to keep it
And here's a secret
If you leave it at home
Then uh, double up uh uh
You can find a bargain
They're really cheap at Target
Don't make this a thin strap
Because it's not a chinstrap
And I gotta be straight when I say "Keep it on"
Till the break of dawn
Yeah, gotta keep it on
You may not like this song
But all the teachers do it
And they're getting used to it
They will lead in-person studies
Get you back with your buddies
There's no reason to frown
When they dress up like a clown
And sing songs
And they're strong
And they're down, get the fiction on, so

[Chorus]
Teachers, yeah
Teachers, yeah
They can't wait to see you
Oh yeah
So put it on, dance around
Even if it's like a cat
Baby got mask

[Outro]
Oh and thank you to the hundreds of teachers who sent us videos getting pumped up for the school year
You are our heroes
For example Thomas in Georgia got much mask
Dana in Virginia got much mask
Come on
Tiffany in Nebraska got much mask
Debra in Alabama got much mask
Mrs. Luke Carolina got much mask
Cameron Pittsboro got much mask
Whoo
