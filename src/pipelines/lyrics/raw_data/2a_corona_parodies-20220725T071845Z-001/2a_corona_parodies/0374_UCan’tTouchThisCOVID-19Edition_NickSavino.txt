[Intro]Alright I think you know this tune And with what’s going on right now in the world I think you might like it Alright here we go [Verse 1]Why, why, why, why Did this happen I don’t know A virus out of control Can’t go anywhere Stuck in my house people need healthcare We’re shut down Everything is closedDon’t touch your face or you might get exposed Stay safe, stay clean I really hate COVID-19 [Chorus]Can’t touch this Please don’t go outside ladies and gentlemen You can’t touch this We literally cannot touch anything Can’t touch this Alright second verse [Verse 2]Empty shelves, long lines Toilet paper’s out and I can’t get wine Wuhan started it all Economy’s down and stock markets fall No crowds No groups Wash your hands after taking a poop Coronavirus Locked in my room got me feeling really pissed COVID-19 This is the year of self-quarantine [Chorus]Please wash your hands I hope you liked this song Can’t touch this No groups over then people, pleaseCan’t touch this Alright here we go [Verse 3]Stay six feet away, back upJobs are gone talk about bad luck Social distance A new term Everyday new cases confirmed The future uncertain Find a vaccine then the tides be turning Up, it’s alright We ain’t going down without a fight Don’t worry, don’t panic Let’s work together and save our planet[Chorus]Can’t touch this You can’t touch thisNot for real though Don’t touch this
