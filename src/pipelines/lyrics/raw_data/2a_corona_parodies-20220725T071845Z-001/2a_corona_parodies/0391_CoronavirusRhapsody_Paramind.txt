[Verse 1]Is this a sore throat?Is this just allergies?Caught in a lockdown No escape from reality Don’t touch your eyes Just hand sanitize quickly  I’m just a poor boyNo job security Cause of easy spread Even though Wash your hands Laying low I look out the window The curve doesn’t look flatter to me To me
