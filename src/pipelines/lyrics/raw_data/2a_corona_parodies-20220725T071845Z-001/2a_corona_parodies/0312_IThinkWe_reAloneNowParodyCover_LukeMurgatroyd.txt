[Verse 1]Self-Isolate That’s what they say when we’re together Better early than late If you’re feeling under the weather[Pre-chorus]So I’m going just as fast as I can Not holding onto anybody’s hand Choosing to hideaway for twenty nights So I get into my pajamas And I hope that work won’t skype me ‘cause I know [Chorus]I’m being alone now Trying to make sure There’s no one else around I’m working from home now Also binge-watching series three of the crown [Chorus]Self-quarantine zone now Checking every hour on the heat of my brow I’m glued to my phone now The beeping of Whatsapp is the only sound[Pre-chorus]So I’m scrolling just as fast as I can Wondering if ole Boris has a plan Not easy to hideaway for twenty nights But it means I won’t be deadly to the old folks that I meet And so that’s why[Chorus]I’m being alone now Making Dam Sure There’s no one else around I’m working from home now Also Drinking all the wine till my worries are drowned[Chorus]So throw me a bone now Saying goodbye to my freelance pounds I’m feeling alone now The beating of my hearts a reassuring sound
