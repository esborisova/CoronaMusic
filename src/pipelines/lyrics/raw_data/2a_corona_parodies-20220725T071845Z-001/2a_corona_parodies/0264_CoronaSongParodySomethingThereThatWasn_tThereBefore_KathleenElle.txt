[First song: Belle][Intro: instrumental][Intro]Little world it’s a quiet planetFrom Wuhan to Arizona Little world full of little people Waking up to say [Pre-Chorus]Corona?Coronavirus, corona, corona, corona [Chorus]Now it’s no wonder that we’re in a frenzyWe don’t have enough test that will Say if this cough I’ve got Is corona or not And I have to go to work to pay my bills [Second song: Something There][Chorus]Oh, isn’t it amazing?Suddenly how unprepared we are Stuck up for who knows how long And wonder why we can’t find toilet paper near or far [Interlude][Verse 1]They said relax It’s just a flu Or perhaps a hoax to take down you know who No, it can’t beWe’ll just ignore But then they’ve never closed the whole wide world before [Interlude][Verse 2]It was just last weekEverything was fine And now we’re all locked up inside for a very long time Six feet away They canceled sports Social distancing I’ve never heard that before [Chorus]New and a bit alarming Who would have ever thought that this could be We thought that global warming Was the greatest threat we’d see in 2020 [Verse 3]Well, who would have thought (well, bless my soul)And who would have known (yes, who indeed)Except for China, Italy, and the WHO (it’s so peculiar) Well, quarantine (we’ll wait and see)A few days more That may be something there that wasn’t there before [Outro]That may be something there that wasn’t there before Let’s hope it’s test, drugs or vaccine may be a cure
