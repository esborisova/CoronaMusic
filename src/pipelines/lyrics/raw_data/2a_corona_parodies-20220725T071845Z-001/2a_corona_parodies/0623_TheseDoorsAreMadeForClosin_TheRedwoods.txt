[Verse 1]
You keep coming and you're looking for me
Corona
Floating 'round to everywhere I've been
Corona
You've been a-messing, where you shouldn't have been a-messing
Corona
Trying every doorknob to get in
Corona

[Chorus]
But these doors are made for closing
And that's just what they'll do
We're gonna keep coronavirus from pushing through

[Verse 2]
I keep washing when I ought to be washing
20 seconds
I keep my distance when I ought to be distant
Six feet
You keep coming when you ought to be a leaving
But if you come here, we're gonna be resistant

[Chorus]
But these doors are made for closing
And that's just what they'll do
We're gonna keep coronavirus from pushing through

[Verse 3]
You keep playing where you shouldn't be playing
Corona
You keep thinking that you'll never get beat
Corona
I just found some hot new disinfectant
Corona
I've got a feeling you can't take the heat
Corona

[Chorus]
But these doors are made for closing
And that's just what they'll do
We're gonna keep coronavirus from pushing through

[Bridge]
Are you ready doors?
Start closing
