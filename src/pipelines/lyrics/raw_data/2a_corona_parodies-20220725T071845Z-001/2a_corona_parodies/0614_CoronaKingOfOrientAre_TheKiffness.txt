[Verse 1]
Corona king of Orient are
Bearing shite it traversed afar
Field and fountain, more and mountain
Infecting you where you are 

[Chorus]
Oh
Flu of wonder, flu of smite
Flu that set this world alight
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us through this year of shite

[Verse 2]
Born corona on Wuhan's plain
Second wave, we crown it again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

[Chorus]
Oh
Flu of wonder, flu of smite
Don't know what is wrong or right
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us through this year of shite

[Verse 3]
Drink your wine, it's better than doom
Breaths of life of gathering gloom
People crying, governments lying
While I sit here in my room

[Chorus]
Oh
Flu of wonder, flu of smite
Doesn't care if you're black or white
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us through this year of shite
