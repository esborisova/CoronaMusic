[Verse 1]They say it started in a lab Other folks they blame Arab Everybody wearing little masks Quarantine But it started out in China, bro They were eating bats you know And pretty soon they were all quarantined[Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantine Buy all the ramen noodles that you can Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantine There's no toilet paper we'll have to use our hands[Verse 2]The media has lost its mind Say that it's the end of time Can’t even watch the major leagues Quarantine The President's on the tv Just declared emergency And all the school's will be closed by next week [Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantine Buy all the ramen noodles that you can Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantine There's no toilet paper we'll have to use our handsEnough toilet paper to last a week I'll be washing in the bathroom sink 'Cause I can’t stand the swamp butt Quarantine They say it's stronger than the mumps I heard it just got Forrest Gump And he didn’t get AIDS from Jenny Quarantine [Chorus]Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantine Buy all the ramen noodles that you can Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantine There's no toilet paper we'll have to use our hands
