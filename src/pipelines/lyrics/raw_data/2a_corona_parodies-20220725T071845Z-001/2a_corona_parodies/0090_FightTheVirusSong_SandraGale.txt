[Verse]
Hey hey 
Time is still wasted, there is no guarantee no
Vaccines in the making, hey we have got to fight the Covid 19
Got so many doctors, they are staying on the scene yes, trying to find the answers, faces full of pain

[Chorus]
I cannot jump on a plane, I cannot get on a cruise, I am going to chill at the house, I have got too much to lose
And when I turn on the news I get knocked on the ground by all this bullshit going down

[verse]
Time is truly wasted, there is no guarantee no
Every life is sacred yes, we have got to fight the Covid 19
I do not understand it, cannot you wear wear a mask? 
Look out for each other, well is that too much to ask? 
There is so much confusion, got to find a way
Look at all the people, well dying everyday


[Chorus]
I cannot jump on a plane, I cannot get on a cruise, I am going to chill at the house, I have got too much to lose
And when I turn on the news I get knocked on the ground by all this bullshit going down

Time is truly wasted, there is no guarantee no
Every life is sacred yes, we have got to fight the Covid 19

[Outro]
We have got to fight, fight the virus
Fight the virus
Fight the virus
Fight the virus
Fight the virus
Fight the virus
Fight the virus
