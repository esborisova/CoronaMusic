[Verse 1]
I know times are pretty strange
Just relax, take it easy
We're stuck at home
Through no one's fault
There's no place we have to go
Love your girl, settle down
If you want, watch some TV
Look at me, my beer is cold
And I'm happy

[Verse 2]
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when the world is 
Going wrong
No it's not
Take your time, drink a lot
Eat your bananas before they're rot
For you will still be here tomorrow
If you do not lose the plot

[Chorus]
How can I try to explain?
Another day in lockdown, I'll go insane
I've spent one whole month in the same territory
And from the moment Cyril talked
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way, and I know
Dad I have to go away
I know, I have to go
I have to go, dad

[Verse 4]
Relax, my son, you're being strange
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're highly strung, that's your fault
There's not much you have to go through
Allow your girl to calm you down 
Just relax, watch some TV
Look at me, my beer is cold
And I'm happy
I know you've said that

[Chorus]
All the times that I've tried
To obey the law and stay inside
It's hard, but it's harder to be for it
I know you're right and I'd agree
If my beers weren't all empty
But there's a way and I know
That I'm making beer today
I know I'm making beer
