[Chorus]
Please tell me what do you got
I want a drink, maybe something that's hot
All I need is a remedy
Because baby I got the flu
[Audible sneeze]
I wash my hands everyday
Somehow I still caught me something anyway
All I need is a remedy 
And if I don't get a remedy 
I am gonna give this to you

[Post-chorus]
Doop-doo-do-do-doo
I got the corona flu
Watch out I might give it to you
Help me, help me!

[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember 
When I could shop at anytime
And I'd wait in line forever
Just to see if I could find
A little bit of toilet paper
Swear I'm about to lose my mind
Because my stupid ugly neighbour
Just brought a hundred pack inside 

[Pre-chorus]
Everybody lost their mind
Everybody thinks that they're dying
But everything gonna be alright
Going to 
[Audible cough x3]

[Chorus]
Please tell me what do you got
I want a drink, maybe something that's hot
All I need is a remedy
Because baby I got the flu
[Audible sneeze]
I wash my hands everyday
Somehow I still caught me something anyway
All I need is a remedy 
And if I don't get a remedy 
I am gonna give this to you

[Post-chorus]
Doop-doo-do-do-doo
I got the corona flu
Watch out I might give it to you
Help me, help me!

[Verse 3]
There's a time that I remember 
When I didn't have this cough
When I wasn't watching Netflix 
More than I was at my job
Every day feel like forever
When this madness going to stop
I can't hold it in much longer 
And now I'm too afraid to shop
