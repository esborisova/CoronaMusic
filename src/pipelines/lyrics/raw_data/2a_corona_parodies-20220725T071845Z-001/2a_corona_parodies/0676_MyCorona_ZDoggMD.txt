[Verse 1]
Ooh, my little Wuhan one, viral one
Coming to congest my lungs, ay, Corona
Zoonotic transmission, where’s it from?
Bats or civet cats? Who knows why, Corona?

[Chorus]
When is it gonna stop
Fever, cough
Wash your dirty hands
Why did I ever stop
In Hubei for vacation, man?
Why achoo
M-m-m-my Corona

[Verse 2]
Don’t you come no closer, huh, no closer, bro
Unless you got an N95, Corona
Got a travel history, I’m quarantined
Should have just quit touching my eyes, Corona

[Chorus]
Never getting off, stuck onboard, 
such a dirty boat
But why ‘you hoarding masks 
When you live in Alaska, though?
Why no
M-m-m-my Corona
M-m-m-my Corona

[Bridge: Spoken word]
Tom, I learned a lot about this virus
I’m glad we came to China
You know, you gotta wash your hands, cover your cough, don’t eat feces
You know, it’s really transmissible
I learned a lot too, I learned a lot too
I learned that you can get a whole civet cat in the Wuhan meat market for 17 yuan
Also fell in love with an Asian lady playing mahjong
Ow

[Solo: Guitar]

[Verse 3]
When is it gonna get to me, get to me?
You killed the doc’ that called you out, why Corona?
Internet conspiracy, COVID-19
Is it just a pack of communist lies, Corona?

[Chorus]
Never gonna stop media
Such a dirty game
Cause no one gets the shot for the flu
But it’s just as lame
Why achoo
M-m-m
God
M-m-m
My Corona

[Bridge: Spoken word]
Can I have a lime with my Corona?
It’s time, Corona
Aren’t you glad we decided to go to China, my bro?
Absolutely not, this is the epicenter
You’re really gonna get infected without a mask
No man, I’m a white American, nothing bad ever happens to us, you know?
I don’t feel so good
He died because of the racism

[Solo: Guitar]
