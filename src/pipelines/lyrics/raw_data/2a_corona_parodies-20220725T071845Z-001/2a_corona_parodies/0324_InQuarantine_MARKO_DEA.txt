
[Spoken words]
I can't take self-isolation anymore 
I need some fresh air, and to be free! 

Come back now!

Ariel listen to me 
The outside world is a mess
Life in isolation is more fun than you think

[Verse 1]
The outdoors may look much greener 
But right now it is not safe 
You dream about going out there 
But that is a big mistake 
Just look at the world around us 
People coughing everywhere 
You don't want to catch this virus 
So you've got to stay right here

[Chorus]
In quarantine 
From COVID-19 
It's way more cleaner 
Germs can’t come near you 
Take it from me 
Out on the streets, you cannot play 
‘Cause you must stay two meters away 
Self-isolation helps save the nation 
In quarantine

[Verse 2]
We don't have to put on lipstick 
‘Cause we're not allowed to kiss 
Just stay in and binge on 
Netflix Or you'll end up like this fish 
Poor Freddie went outside today 
He thought he could break the law 
But now he don't feel okay 
I should have just stayed indoors

[Chorus]
In quarantine 
Keep your hands clean 
You can wear no clothes 
You won't feel exposed 
Enjoy and be free 
Tidy our bedroom learn to cook 
If you get bored then read a book 
Skype all your buddies 
Do online studies 
In quarantine 

[Chorus]
Stock up toilet paper 
You'll need that for later 
But don't take from me 
Wash those hands daily 
Sanitize greatly 
Keep social distance 
To save our existence 
Life in isolation 
Can help save the nation 
From COVID-19
