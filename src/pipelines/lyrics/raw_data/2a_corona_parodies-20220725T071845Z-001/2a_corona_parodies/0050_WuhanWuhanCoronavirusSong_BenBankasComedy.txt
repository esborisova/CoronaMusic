[Intro" spoken]
I always wanted to go to Wuhan, seemed like such a nice place
Wanted to travel China, learn all about the cultures
The different foods that they eat over there
Boy, is it different
What a big city

[Verse 1]
Start spreading the flu
I'm going to sneeze
I want to be a part of it
Wuhan, Wuhan

[Verse 2]
Fear ahead
I have a fever
I've been eating lots of bats
Wuhan Wuhan 

[Verse 3
I wanna wake up in a hospital, built in two weeks 
Coronavirus, bodies in the streets
Oh, it's not spreading the flu 
We're gonna die today
I'm in the heart of it 
In Old Wuhan 

[Outro]
Fucking make it there, fucking make it anywhere
Oh Wuhan, Wuhan
