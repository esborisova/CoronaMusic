[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got no appetite
My chest is tight
Is it a deadly virus or do I have corona?
I think I should be quarantined
There’s no vaccine
I need to get a doctor on the telephone-ah

[Chorus]
Doctors says I’m fine
But he’s lying
He won’t call me back
Doctor’s all agree 
Patty G’s
A hypochondriac
I I I I I
Whoo

[Bridge]
M-m-m-m-might have Corona
M-m-m have Corona
