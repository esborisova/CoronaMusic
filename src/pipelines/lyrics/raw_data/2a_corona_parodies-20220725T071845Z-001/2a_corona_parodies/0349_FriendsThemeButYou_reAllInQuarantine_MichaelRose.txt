[Verse 1]So no one told you life was gonna be this way Your job's remote, you're broke, you're hiding from the plague [Pre-chorus]It's like you're always stuck in Quarantine And you might be there a day, a week, a month - or even a year[Chorus]I'll be there for you Washing my hands all day I'll be there for you Standing 6 feet away I'll be there for you 'Cause you're there for me too[Verse 2]You're still in bed at 10, your boss skyped you at 8 The Wolt guy brings you breakfast, things are going great Your crazy Uncle's been saying for years The Apocalypse is coming so stay home - keep watching Netflix[Chorus]I'll be there for you Washing my hands all day I'll be there for you Standing 6 feet away I'll be there for you 'Cause you're there for me too[Bridge]No one could ever know me No one could ever see me Seems you're the only one who knows What it's like to be meSomeone to face the day with Make it through all the rest with Someone I'll always laugh with Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah [Solo: Guitar][Pre-chorus]It sucks we're all just stuck in Quarantine And I hope to see you soon, my friends As soon as we win![Chorus]I'll be there for you Washing my hands all day I'll be there for you Standing 6 feet away I'll be there for you 'Cause you're there for me too
