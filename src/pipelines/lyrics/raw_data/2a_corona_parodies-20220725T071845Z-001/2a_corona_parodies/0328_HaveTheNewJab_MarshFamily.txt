[Verse 1]I heard there was a rumor shared That COVID vaccines were unprepared Or brewed to realty censure and control you Well, it goes like this - a fourth or fifth Of people might all fall for this They’re thinking of opposing having new jabs [Chorus]Have the new jabHave the new jabHave the new jabHave the new jab[Verse 2]Well, the science is strong and they’ve yielded proof You won’t grow scales or camel’s hooves They duly checked with trails, and the approved them It’s biological warfare They broke all records – but still took care So please do not refuse to have the new jab[Chorus]Have the new jabHave the new jabHave the new jabHave the new jab[Interlude][Verse 3]Well maybe, we all get misled We see this post on our WhatsApp thread They use conspiracy theories, just to fool youIt’s not needle pricks to be scared about It’s the ones who out this nonsense out It’s absurd and it’s mistaken, have the new jab[Chorus]Have the new jabHave the new jabHave the new jabHave the new jab[Interlude][Verse 3]Maybe there’s a plan above To implant things into our blood But why on earth would Bill Gates want to rule you And it’s not a trick to get you spayedIt’s not some change to out DNAIt’s a COVID-fighting weapon – have the new jab[Chorus]Have the new jabHave the new jabHave the new jabHave the new jab[Verse 4]Well, there are sometimes we make a choice A personal view, a protest voice But other times we’re part of something greater So remember this ain’t just for you Your jab’s protecting others tooAnd every breath we save is hallelujah [Chorus]Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
