[Verse 1]
She went out to eat on a Saturday night
She was fearing for her life 
And the restaurant girl wasn't wearing a mask
We all said she's crazy
She got home at ten and went to bed
And she wasn't feeling right
'Cause she had a tickle in her throat
She said, "oh no" and "holy crap"

[Pre-chorus]
Does she have Covid-19?
Does she need to quarantine?
She's obsessively reading the WebMD

[Chorus]
Hypochondriac, chondriac once more
Googling symptoms and staying up till four hypochondriac, chondriac that's for sure
And she's stressing like she's never stressed before, yeah

[Verse 2]
Then I wake up feeling kind of rough
And my throat is kind of dry
And I'm dizzy so I shout out loud
"I have Covid, I'm gonna die"
Then my kids freak out, 'cause they are kids
And they scream and run away
Then my wife comes in and reminds me 
That last night I had six IPA's

[Pre-chorus]
I scared everyone for sure
It was just a hangover
I don't really need to call the CDC

[Chorus]
Hypochondriac, chondriac once more
It's a hangover and I'm not on death's door
Hypochondriac, chondriac on the floor
And she says shut up, get up and do your chores

[Bridge]
[Spoken Word]
So here's the thing. We're super careful. We wear a mask. We wash our hands non-stop. But I one time used a pen of the, the delivery food guy, I swear to God, the next day I start coughing, I, I, I, I go to the grocery store, I'm like, do I have Covid? Forget about it. This guy, one night he had a few too many beers, he's like "oh sorry, honey" 

[Pre-chorus]
Check my temperature each day
Every time I am afraid
But it's always just seasonal allergies

[Chorus]
Hypochondriac, chondriac that's for sure
And I'm always checking on my temperature
Hypochondriac, chondriac on the floor
And I'm stressing like I've never stressed before, yeah
