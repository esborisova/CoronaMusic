[Verse 1]
No soap or loo rolls on the shelf
We need to isolate ourselves
That's what we've all been told to do
Stay indoors, save a few
That's what I want you to do

[Verse 2]
Boris has said repeatedly
Keep two meters between you and me
Stay home and save the NHS
Or we'll all end up in a mess
Don't go to Cornwall or Inverness

[Chorus]
Just wash your hands and your thumbs
Scrub your nails and put on sanitizer too
Wear rubber gloves when you open the door
Another suggestion for you
You'll save your health and the elders around you will be safer that's my plea
So don't help yourself to my lips, to my arms
Please stay far away from me
Alright, ha ha ha, yeah 

[Verse 3]
If we had done what I would do
We might have got out in a month or two
But now we've been put on lockdown
And that really makes me frown
Because of all you stupid clowns

[Chorus]
Just wash your hands and your thumbs
Scrub your nails and put on sanitizer too
Wear rubber gloves when you open the door
Another suggestion for you
You'll save your health and the elders around you will be safer, including me
So don't help yourself to my lips or my arms
Please stay far away from me
Don't help yourself 
Yeah
