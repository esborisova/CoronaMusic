[Verse 1]
Somewhere in America 
The toilet paper's gone
Empty shelves in all the stores
All I have left is this roll

[Verse 2]
There's no more toilet paper
No tissues or paper towel 
Can't find it anywhere
But I do have this brush

[Bridge]
Someday I'll wish for better times
When the toilet paper is abundant
And tissues and the paper towel
And lysol and the Clorox wipes 
Are fully stocked 

[Verse 3]
Someday in America 
We will not be in fear
But for now 
Here's a baby Yoda meme
