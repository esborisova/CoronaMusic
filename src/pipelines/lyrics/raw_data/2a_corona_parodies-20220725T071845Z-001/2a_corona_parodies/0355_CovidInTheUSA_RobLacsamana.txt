[Verse 1]
Pulled into the store with my shopping list 
Stocking up for a quarantine 
Everybody’s pushing, the lines are long 
Somebody coughed on me
I look around and the shelves are empty 
All they have is easter candy 
Everyone’s in a panic 
I should have bought it all last week 
My tummy’s turning – am I actually getting sick? 
Too much pressure with the virus 
When the manager came on the intercom 
He said the bathroom tissue’s gone 
Yeah, the bathroom tissue’s gone 
All the bathroom tissue’s gone 

[Chorus]
So I put my gloves on 
Handshakes gone 
Socially distancing 
Washing my hands like yeah 
Wearing my mask like yeah 
Put my gloves on 
Handshakes gone 
Newspaper for toilet paper 
Yeah, it’s a national emergency 
Yeah, COVID-19
