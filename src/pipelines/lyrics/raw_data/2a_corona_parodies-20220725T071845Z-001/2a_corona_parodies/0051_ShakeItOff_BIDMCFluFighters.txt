[Verse]
I've got body aches, I've got a fever and the shakes 
So what was my mistake? Did I forgot to vaccinate? 
Was it that who who shook my hand? Is that where it began? 
I just don't understand, I just don't understand 

[Pre-chorus]
I had the blues and the doc said: “It's the flu, man”
She said “I've got some news here, my advice, if you wash it'll be alright”

[Chorus]
There's a rule you must obey, bey-bey-bey-bey 
To keep the flu away, way-way-way-way 
Gotta wash them like you're crazy, cray-cray-cray-cray 
Shake them off, shake them off 
There's no reason to delay, lay-lay-lay-lay
Get your flu shot right away, way-way-way-way 
And show off your band aid, aid-aid-aid-aid 
Shake it off, shake it off 

[Verse]
Now I'm squeaky clean
The soap dispenser fiend 
The cal stat pumping queen, the cal stat pumping queen 
Take your time, it's not a race, don't want to leave a trace
Please don't touch your face, please don't touch your face

[Pre-chorus]
Cover up your cough, man, sneeze into your sleeve, man
Stay at home if you’re sick, man, and my advice if you wash it'll be alright 

[Chorus]
There's a rule you must obey, bey-bey-bey-bey 
To keep the flu away, way-way-way-way 
Gotta wash them like you're crazy, cray-cray-cray-cray 
Shake them off, shake them off 
If you think they look ok, kay-kay-kay-kay
You should wash them anyway anyway, way-way-way-way
Get your flu shot right away, way-way-way-way

[Post-chorus]
Shake it off, shake it off 
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off

[Interldue: spoken]
Hey, hey, hey, just think
While you were getting sick
And spreading all those dirty, dirty germs everywhere
You could have just avoided getting sick this week

[Bridge]
Getting this sick this week
My best friend put the flu to an end 
Because she pumps going out and she pumps going in 
So the patient over there with the hell of good hair you should wash a little more and then shake, shake, shake 

[Chorus]
There's a rule you must obey, bey-bey-bey-bey 
To keep the flu away, way-way-way-way 
Gotta wash them like you're crazy, cray-cray-cray-cray 
Shake them off, shake them off 
If you think they look ok, kay-kay-kay-kay
You should wash them anyway, way-way-way-way
And make sure to vaccinate, ate-ate-ate-ate

[Outro]
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off 
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
Shake it off, shake it off
