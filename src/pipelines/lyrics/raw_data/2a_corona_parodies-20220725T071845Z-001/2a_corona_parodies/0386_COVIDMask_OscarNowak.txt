[Spoken words]Calling all cars, calling all cars. Man trying to enter an office building in on forth in Maine with no mask. Repeat no mask. [Verse 1]I walked into my job late last weekWhen my co-workers all began to freak They started cursing and began to shout And quite rudely as the boss threw me out [Chorus]You need a mask I need a COVID mask A COVID mask It seemed a lot to ask To wear a mask To do a simple task Put on a mask I need a COVID mask [Verse 2]Made it mandatory almost every place That we can’t be seen unless we hide our face I can’t even leave my humble abode Without something covering my mouth and nose [Chorus]We need a mask We need a COVID mask A COVID mask It seemed a lot to ask To wear a mask Can’t even mow my grass Without a maskWithout a COVID mask [Verse 3]This mask wearing isn’t fun And the snitching has now begun My neighbor called the hotline ‘Cause my dog wasn’t wearing one [Verse 4]Walking through the mall a woman’s voice did ring Seems she was troubled by just one thing She pointed to the door shoot her fist and said What are trying to do you jerk make everybody sick?[Chorus]Forgot his mask Forgot my COVID mask His COVID mask Nobody gets a passThat stupid mask Can’t even pump my gas Without a mask Without a COVID mask [Spoken words]Honey, I’m home What do you want?I need to come in and get my mask Don’t let daddy in the house, mommy. He’s never wearing his mask No mask, no entry, sorryBut honeyYou should have taking it with you You’re not getting in this house I’ve changed the locks.
